# Notes on modifierId

These notes provide additional information about the modifierId column in the [Relationship File](../../../../../../4.2.3-Relationship-File-Specification_28739341.html). The modifierId column was included in the specification of the relationships file in the expectation that it would in future distinguish between different types of description logic axiom. However, in practice it has not been used. Different approaches to enhanced use of description logic are under consideration and it now seems unlikely that this column will be used as originally intended. Therefore, until further notice it is recommended that the contents of this column should be ignored.

The following notes were included in the original specification of modifierId and are retained here for consistency.
