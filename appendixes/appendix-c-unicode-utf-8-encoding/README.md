# Appendix C. Unicode UTF-8 encoding

[UTF-8](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-8) is an efficient encoding of [Unicode](../../Unicode_28739320.html) character - [String](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/String+\(data+type\)) that recognizes the fact that the majority of text-based communications are in ASCII. It therefore optimizes the encoding of these characters.

[Unicode](../../Unicode_28739320.html) is preferred to ASCII because it permits the inclusion of accents, scientific symbols and characters used in [languages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language) other than English. The [UTF-8](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-8) format is a standard encoding that provides the most efficient means of encoding 16-bit [Unicode](../../Unicode_28739320.html) characters in cases where the majority of characters are in the ASCII range. Both [UTF-8](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-8) and the alternative [UTF-16](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-16) encoding are supported by all widely used operating systems and major applications. UTF-8 was adopted is an [IETF Internet Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629) (it was initially adopted by IETF in 1996 to restrict some code values in 1998 and 2003). In 2008 UTF-8 became the most widely used for of encoding in web pages.

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT) uses the [UTF-8](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-8) representation[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Appendix+C.+Unicode+UTF-8+encoding#Footnote1) of characters in [terms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/term) and other text fields.
