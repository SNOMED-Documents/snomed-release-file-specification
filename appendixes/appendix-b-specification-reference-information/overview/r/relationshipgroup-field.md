# relationshipGroup (field)

Field in the [Relationship File](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Relationship+File) is used to group [Relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Relationship) together for a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept). For example, where a particular type of prosthesis is inserted a joint, the [Defining characteristics](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Defining+characteristic) describing the prosthesis type would be in one group whereas those describing the location or laterality of the joint would be in another group.
