# utf-16

## UTF-16

A standard method of directly encoding [Unicode](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Unicode) using two bytes for every character.

Note: SNOMED CT release files do not use UTF-16. However, the UTF-8 representation used in release files can be converted to UTF-16.
