## D.1 Stated and Inferred Definitions - Examples

The appendix contains an extended version of [2.3.1 Stated and Inferred Concept Definitions](../../2.3.1-Stated-and-Inferred-Concept-Definitions_71172644.html) supported by more detailed examples.

## Stated View of Concept Definitions

[SNOMED CT concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept) are defined by assertions made by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+author). The [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) asserted by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+author) are known as the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view).

The [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) is a representation of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) consisting only of assertions made or revised by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT%C2%A0author).

#### Notes

* In contrast to the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view), the _stated view_ does not include inferences generated by applying a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier).
* The _stated view_ is represented by [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom), that conform to the [OWL functional syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+functional+syntax). These [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom) are distributed in the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file)

## Description Logic Classification

A [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier) can apply logical rules to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) to create inferences. The end result of this process is an [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition).

## Inferred Views of Concept Definitions

The [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) is a representation of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) that is logically derived by applying a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier) to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view).

#### Notes

* Different _inferred views_ can be derived from the same [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) by applying different rules that selectively exclude some types of assertions.
* Different _inferred views_ may be [semantically equivalent](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/semantic+equivalence) to one another provided that assertions are only excluded if they are redundant (i.e. can be _inferred_ from assertions that are included). However, in some cases, an _inferred view_ may not completely represent the [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) but may serve a specific purpose.

## Illustration of the Effect of Classification

[Table D.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/D.1+Stated+and+Inferred+Definitions+-+Examples#Table-stated-view-procedures) shows the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) of the definitions of [710785000 | Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) . Compare this with the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) of the same concept in [Table D.1-2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/D.1+Stated+and+Inferred+Definitions+-+Examples#Table-inferred-view-proc) and you can see that the single [supertype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/supertype) concept [71388002 | Procedure|](http://snomed.info/id/71388002) been replaced by four [supertype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/supertype) concepts in the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view).

The [classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/classifier) has compared the definition of [710785000 | Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) with the concept definitions shown in [Table D.1-3](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/D.1+Stated+and+Inferred+Definitions+-+Examples#Table-stated-view-supertypes) and determined that [710785000 | Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) is a subtype of all these concepts.

In fact, the classifier will also have found several other supertypes but the inferred view distributed in the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file) only includes proximal supertypes (parents). Other supertype ancestors are excluded from the file because they are redundant [1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/D.1+Stated+and+Inferred+Definitions+-+Examples#Footnote1) .
