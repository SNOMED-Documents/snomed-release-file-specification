# Appendix D: Concept Definition Illustrations

A [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) is a set of one or more [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom) that partially or sufficiently specify the meaning of a [SNOMED CT concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept).

### Notes

* _Concept definitions_ are represented in two ways in [SNOMED CT release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+file):\
  \* As a [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) represented by [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom) that conform to the [OWL Functional Syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+Functional+Syntax) distributed in the [OWL Expression Reference Set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+Expression+Reference+Set+file).\
  \* As an [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) represented by [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship) that are distributed in the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file). The _inferred view_ is generated by applying [description logic classification](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classification) to the _stated view_.
* _Concept definitions_ include two distinct elements
  * Axioms that assert that a concept is a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype) of one or more other concepts. In the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) these are represented as [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship).
  * Axioms that assert characteristics of a concept that distinguish it from its [supertypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/supertype). In the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) these are represented as [attribute relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/attribute+relationship).

This appendix illustrates some of the features of concept definitions outlined in section [2.3 Concept Definitions](../../2.3-Concept-Definitions_71172643.html).
