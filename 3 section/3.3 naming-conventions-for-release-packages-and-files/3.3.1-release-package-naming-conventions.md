# Package Name Elements

**Element**| **Values**| **Description**  
---|---|---  
Product| <any>| Camel case short title sufficient to identify the product.  
Scope (optional)| Edition| The release files included in the package fully resolve all dependencies of all modules included in the package.  
Extension| The release files included in the package needs to be combined with the International Edition release package and any other packages required to resolve the dependencies declared by the[ Module Dependency Reference Set](5.2.4.2-Module-Dependency-Reference-Set_28739379.html).  
Format (optional)| RF1| Required for any release packages containing [Release Format 1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Release+Format+1 "Glossary link: Release Format 1") files.  
RF2| Current value for all release packages.  
<other>| Other values may be specified in future.  
ReleaseStatus| ALPHA| The package is an  [alpha release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/alpha+release+package "Glossary link: alpha release package"), which is defined as  a [SNOMED CT release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release package") made available only for initial review and testing by implementers and other stakeholders. 

### Notes

  * An _alpha release package_ must not be used in production clinical systems or in clinical settings. This includes [Affiliate Licensees](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Affiliate+Licensee "Glossary link: Affiliate Licensees") or any third parties, except those who have formally committed to test it.
  * An _alpha release_ is used to test the format and content of the [SNOMED CT release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release"). Feedback is elicited and changes are made prior to publication of the [beta release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/beta+release "Glossary link: beta release").
  * _Alpha releases_ were formerly known as a [technology preview](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/technology+preview "Glossary link: technology preview") releases.

  
  
| BETA| The package is a  [beta release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/beta+release+package "Glossary link: beta release package"), which is defined as  a [SNOMED CT release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release package") made available for review and testing only. 

### Notes

  * Implementers and other stakeholders review and test the _beta release_.
  * The _beta release package_ is made available prior to the [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"). It must not be used in production clinical systems or in clinical settings. This includes Affiliate Licensees or any third parties, except those who have formally committed to test it.
  * The _beta release_ status indicates it is expected to subsequently be confirmed as a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"). If there is significant issue in format or content, it may be withdrawn, or replaced with an updated  _beta release package_. Whether or not it becomes a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release") is decided shortly before the due date for the next release. If a  _beta release_ is subsequently confirmed as a [production release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release "Glossary link: production release"), all updates are fully version-tracked from the date of the  _beta release_. 
  * Beta releases were formerly known as [candidate baseline](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/candidate+baseline "Glossary link: candidate baseline") releases.

  
  
| PRODUCTION| The package is a  [production release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/production+release+package "Glossary link: production release package"), which is defined as  a final, formally endorsed [SNOMED CT release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release package") intended for live use in appropriately licensed operational systems. 

### Notes

  * A _production release package_ represents the authoritative release of the product. Implementers can use it in operational clinical systems.
  * The _production release_ status indicates that the releasing party ([SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International "Glossary link: SNOMED International") or the owner of the [extension](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension "Glossary link: extension")) commits to maintain the release history. Thus the historical audit trail is maintained through the product's lifetime.
