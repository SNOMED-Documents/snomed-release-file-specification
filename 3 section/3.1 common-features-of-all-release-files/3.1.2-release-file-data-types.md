The following data types are used in the [release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file "Glossary link: release files"): 

Table 3.1.2-1: Data Types Used in Release Files

**Data Type**| **Description**  
---|---  
[SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")| A [SNOMED CT identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+identifier "Glossary link: SNOMED CT identifier"), between 6 and 18 digits long, as described in [6.2 SCTID Representation](6.2-SCTID-Representation_33490092.html). 

  * This data type is used to identify [SNOMED components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+component "Glossary link: SNOMED components"), to refer to a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") from another [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") or from a [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set"), and also to represent the values for [concept enumerations](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+enumeration "Glossary link: concept enumerations") (see Concept Enumerations.). 

  
[UUID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/UUID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: UUID \(\(data type\)\)")| A Universally Unique Identifier is a 128-bit unsigned generated using a standard algorithm.

  * UUIDs are represented as strings of hexadecimal characters split by - characters as points specified by the [UUID standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). 

  
[Integer](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Integer+\(field\) "Reference term: Integer \(field\)")| A 32-bit signed integer.  
[String](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/String+\(data+type\) "Reference term: String \(\(data type\)\)")| [UTF-8](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/UTF-8 "Glossary link: UTF-8") text of a specified length.   
[Boolean](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Boolean+\(data+type\) "Reference term: Boolean \(\(data type\)\)")| A Boolean value, represented as one of two possible integer values (1 = true, 0 = false).   
[Time](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Time+\(data+type\) "Reference term: Time \(\(data type\)\)")| A date and time format expressed as a text string in line the basic representation specified in the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). 

  * Where only date is required the format is YYYYMMDD (e.g. 20180125 refers to 25th January 2018) 
  * Where a time is also required the _YYYYMMDDThhmmss_ Z (e.g. 20180125T123000Z refers to 12:30 UTC on 25th January 2018) 
  * The time should be expressed as UTC, as indicated by the trailing "Z".

  
  
# Concept Enumerations

[Concept enumeration](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Concept+enumeration "Glossary link: Concept enumeration") is the  a set of [SNOMED CT concept identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+identifier "Glossary link: SNOMED CT identifier") used to represent values for a property of a [SNOMED CT component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT component") or [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member"). 

### Notes

  *  _Concept enumeration_ serves the same purpose as more general approaches to providing enumerated lists of values (i.e. assigning a number to a value). However, the use of [SNOMED CT concept identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+identifier "Glossary link: SNOMED CT identifier") allows access to the human readable meaning of each enumeration using [descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") in the same way for other concepts.
  * The [SNOMED CT concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept "Glossary link: SNOMED CT concepts") used to represent _concept enumerations_ are usually [subtype children](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+children "Glossary link: subtype children") (or [descendants](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/descendant "Glossary link: descendants")) of [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") in the [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") metadata hierarchy. Each possible value is represented by a single child [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). This allows updates to the permitted values to be tracked using the [component history](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component+history "Glossary link: component history") mechanism.
