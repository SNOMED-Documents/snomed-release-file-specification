# 3.1.6 Module Identification

Each [SNOMED CT component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT component") is managed and maintained in a [module](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/module "Glossary link: module") identified by its [moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(\(field\)\)") field.

A [SNOMED CT module](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+module "Glossary link: SNOMED CT module") is defined as  a group of [SNOMED CT components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT components") and/or [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") managed, maintained, and distributed as a unit. 

### Notes

  * [Components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Component "Glossary link: Components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") that are part of the same  _module_ share the same [moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(field\)") value.
  * All  _modules_ , except the [ 900000000000012004 | SNOMED CT model component module|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000012004 "900000000000012004 | SNOMED CT model component module |") , have dependencies on other  _modules_ specified by the [Module Dependency Reference Set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEXTPG/4.3.2.4.2+Module+Dependency+Reference+Set).  

    * [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members"), that are part of the same  _module,_ share the same [moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(field\)") value.
    * [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") are part of only one  _module_ , at any given time.
  * The organization responsible for maintaining an [extension](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension "Glossary link: extension") must:  

    * create and maintain at least one  _module_ identified by a  _moduleId_ that it has created;
    * apply a _moduleId_ that it has created to all [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") in its _extension_ ;
    * manage and distribute information about the dependencies of its  _modules_ in accordance with SNOMED CT specifications.
  * The organization responsible for maintaining an [extension](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension "Glossary link: extension") may:
    * create and maintain multiple  _modules_ ;
    * organize its [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") within the modules it manages in a way that best meets its business needs;
    * move a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") or [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") between its  _modules_ by creating a revised version of that [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") or [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") with a different  _moduleId_(It is then part of the new  _module_ from the  _effectiveTime_ of the revised version).
  * [Components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Component "Glossary link: Components") and [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") may be moved between  _modules_ maintained by different organizations. However, such moves must only be made:
    * with the consent of the organizations responsible for both the source and target modules; and
    * in accordance with rules specified by [SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International "Glossary link: SNOMED International").
