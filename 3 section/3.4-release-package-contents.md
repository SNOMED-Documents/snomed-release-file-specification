# 3.4 Release Package Contents

This subsection provides illustrated notes on the contents of the [SNOMED CT International release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+International+release+package "Glossary link: SNOMED CT International release package") used to distribute the [SNOMED International Edition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International+Edition "Glossary link: SNOMED International Edition"). Similar folder structures should be present in other [release packages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+package "Glossary link: release packages"). However, the files included may be limited to those required to represent the [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components") and/or [reference set members](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set members") in that particular [release package](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+package "Glossary link: release package"). 

[Figure 3.4-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/3.4+Release+Package+Contents#Figure-package "Release package folder structure") shows the overall structure of a release package. The top level folder is named according to the [Release Package Naming Conventions](3.3.1-Release-Package-Naming-Conventions_56330442.html). It contains one subfolder for each of the [Release Types](3.2-Release-Types_28739357.html) (Delta, Full and Snapshot). Each release type folder contains a Terminology folder and a Refset folder. The Refset folders contains separate folders for different groups of reference sets (Content, Language, Map and Metadata).
