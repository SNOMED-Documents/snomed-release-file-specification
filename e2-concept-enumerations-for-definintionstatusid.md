# E.2 Concept Enumerations for definintionStatusId

This concept enumeration represents a value that can be applied to the concept.[definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate whether the current set of [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") applied to a _concept_ are sufficient to define it relative to its supertypes.  [Table E.2-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/E.2+Concept+Enumerations+for+definintionStatusId#Table-defstatus "Definition status \(core metadata concept\) \(900000000000444006\)") shows the current set of values for this concept enumeration.

The [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is currently considered to be [primitive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive "Glossary link: primitive").A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") or [expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/expression "Glossary link: expression") for which all these defining _relationships_ are true **may** be equivalent to or subsumed by this [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). However, it is not possible to compute this from the definition - because the missing element in the definition may or may not apply to the other [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") or [expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/expression "Glossary link: expression").Any [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") or [expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/expression "Glossary link: expression") for which any of these defining _relationships_ is not true is neither equivalent to nor subsumed by this [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept").
