# Appendix D: Concept Definition Illustrations

A [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") is a set of one or more [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axioms") that partially or sufficiently specify the meaning of a [SNOMED CT concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept "Glossary link: SNOMED CT concept").

### Notes

  *  _Concept definitions_ are represented in two ways in [SNOMED CT release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+file "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release files"):
    * As a [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") represented by [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axioms") that conform to the [OWL Functional Syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+Functional+Syntax "Glossary link: OWL Functional Syntax") distributed in the [OWL Expression Reference Set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+Expression+Reference+Set+file "Reference term: OWL Expression Reference Set file").
    * As an [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") represented by [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships") that are distributed in the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file"). The _inferred view_ is generated by applying [description logic classification](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classification "Glossary link: description logic classification") to the  _stated view_.
  * _Concept definitions_ include two distinct elements
    * Axioms that assert that a concept is a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtype") of one or more other concepts. In the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") these are represented as [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship "Glossary link: subtype relationships").
    * Axioms that assert characteristics of a concept that distinguish it from its [supertypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/supertype "Glossary link: supertypes"). In the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") these are represented as [attribute relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/attribute+relationship "Glossary link: attribute relationships").

This appendix illustrates some of the features of concept definitions outlined in section [2.3 Concept Definitions](2.3-Concept-Definitions_71172643.html).
