# Release Package Contents

This subsection provides illustrated notes on the contents of the SNOMED CT International release package used to distribute the SNOMED International Edition. Similar folder structures should be present in other release packages. However, the files included may be limited to those required to represent the components and/or reference set members in that particular release package.

***

> **This Figure shows the overall structure of a release package. The top level folder is named according to the Release Package Naming Conventions. It contains one subfolder for each of the Release Types (Delta, Full and Snapshot). Each release type folder contains a Terminology folder and a Refset folder. The Refset folders contains separate folders for different groups of reference sets (Content, Language, Map and Metadata).**

> **This Figure shows the contents of the Terminology folder. In this case, the files shown are those for the Full release type. Details of most of these files are shown in section** [**Component Release Files Specification**](<../4 component-release-files-specification/>)**, while the OWL refsets follow the specification of the** [**OWL Expression Reference Set**](<../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.1 content-reference-sets/5.2.1.9-owl-expression-reference-set.md>)**.**

**Notes**

* The same file types are present in the other release Terminology folders (Snapshot Release Folder + Delta Release Folder). However, the word "Full" in the filenames is replaced by the appropriate release type name ("Snapshot" or "Delta").
* The Identifier file contains no data in the International release and can be ignored.
* The Stated Relationship file has now been deprecated as of 2019.  It will remain static and in place in the International Edition package until such time as the community agrees that it is reasonable and safe to remove it completely.

> **This Figure shows the contents of the Refset subfolders. In this case, the files shown are those for the Full release type. The names of the reference set files correspond the reference set types and the structure of each reference set type is specified in section** [**Reference Set Types**](<../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/>)**.**

**Notes**

* The same file types are present in the other release Terminology folders (Snapshot Release Folder + Delta Release Folder). However, the word "Full" in the filenames is replaced by the appropriate release type name ("Snapshot" or "Delta").
* Other release packages may include different collections of reference sets to support the intended uses of that package. Similarly, subsequent releases of a package may include additional reference set files that support additional functionality.
