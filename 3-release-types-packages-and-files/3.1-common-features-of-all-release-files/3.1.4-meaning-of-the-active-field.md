# 3.1.4 Meaning of the Active Field

Each [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") has an associated [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") field, which can take values of true (1) or false (0). The meaning of this flag is described by [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") type i n the following table: 

Table 3.1.4-1: Behavior of Active and Inactive Components

**Component Type**|  Active **value**|  Component **behavior when the most recent row representing a component has the specified active value**  
---|---|---

  * The [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is intended for [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") use. 
  * All [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")[descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") for which the conceptId refers to this [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") are valid. Visibility of these [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")[descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") depends on information contained in applicable refset members (for example, whether the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") is in a [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: language")[dialect](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/dialect "Glossary link: dialect")[reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set") that is currently enabled in the vendor's system). 
  * All [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")[relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") of which it is the [sourceId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/sourceId+\(field\) "Reference term: sourceId \(\(field\)\)") or [destinationId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/destinationId+\(field\) "Reference term: destinationId \(\(field\)\)") are applicable. 

  
Concept| False| 

  * The [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is not intended for [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") use. However, it remains a valid [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") for historical purposes as part of the [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") commitment to the principle of ' [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") permanence'. 
  * Valid [descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") of the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") remain [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") allowing it to be appropriately viewed in human-readable form. 
  * An [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive")[concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") cannot be the [sourceId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/sourceId+\(field\) "Reference term: sourceId \(\(field\)\)"), [destinationId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/destinationId+\(field\) "Reference term: destinationId \(\(field\)\)") or [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)") of an [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")[relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship").

  
Description| True|

Relationship| True| 

  * The [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") represents a valid association of the type specified by the [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)"), between two [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") referred to by the [sourceId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/sourceId+\(field\) "Reference term: sourceId \(\(field\)\)") and [destinationId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/destinationId+\(field\) "Reference term: destinationId \(\(field\)\)") ;

Relationship| False| 

  * The [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") is not valid. An [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive")[relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") should be ignored as it does not apply. 
  * This does not necessarily mean that the association indicated by the [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") does not apply. The [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") may be [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive") because it is redundant and inferable based on other [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")[relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships").

Refset member| True| 

  * The refset member contains valid information applicable to the [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") referred to by the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)") . 
  * The [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") referred to by the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)") may be [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") or [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive"). An [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") refset member cannot make an [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive")[component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component")[active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") but may provide related information that continues to be relevant (e.g. the reason for inactivation). 

  
Refset member| False|
