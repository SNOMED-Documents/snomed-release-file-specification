# Release File Naming Convention

## Overall Naming Pattern

The basic pattern for SNOMED CT release file names consists of five elements, each separated by an underscore (" **\_** ") and followed by a full stop (" **.** ") and a file extension:

#### \[<mark style="color:blue;">FileType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">ContentType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">ContentSubType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">CountryNamespace</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">VersionDate</mark>].\[<mark style="color:blue;">FileExtension</mark>]

Each element in the above structure is described in more detail by table in the following section.

## FileType Element

The FileType element of the filename designates the type and intended use of the release file. It consists of a 3 to 5 alphanumeric code with letters in lowercase.

The code comprises the following three sub-elements. The Type sub-element is required in all cases, other elements are required where relevant and otherwise omitted.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="124"></th><th width="102.0546875" align="center"></th><th width="517.171875"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sub-element</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Values</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td align="center">&#x3C;blank></td><td>General release file</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td align="center">x</td><td>Provisional release file (e.g. part of an alpha or beta release package ).</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td align="center">z</td><td>Archival or unsupported file</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td align="center">sct</td><td>Terminology Data File</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td align="center">der</td><td>Derivative Work Data File (e.g. Reference set release file)</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td align="center">doc</td><td>Documentation</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td align="center">res</td><td>Implementation Resource Data File (e.g. a data file not following a SNOMED CT standard release file format)</td></tr><tr><td>Type</td><td align="center">tls</td><td>Implementation Resource Tool (e.g. scripts or other software made available to process a release file)</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td align="center">1</td><td>Release Format 1</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td align="center">2</td><td>Release Format 2</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td align="center">&#x3C;blank></td><td>Not specific to a release version</td></tr></tbody></table>

## ContentType Element

The ContentSubType element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It describes the content and purpose of the file. It consists of 2-48 alphanumeric characters in camel case.

The content of this element depends on the first element (FileType) of the filename, as described below:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="195.734375"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Value</strong></td><td><strong>Usage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Concept</td><td>The file conforms to the <a href="../../4 component-release-files-specification/4.2 file-format-specifications/4.2.1-concept-file-specification.md">Concept File Specification</a> and contains data related to a set of concepts.</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship</td><td>The file conforms to the <a href="../../4 component-release-files-specification/4.2 file-format-specifications/4.2.3-relationship-file-specification.md">Relationship File Specification</a> and contains relationships that represent the distribution normal form inferred view of a set of concept definitions.</td></tr><tr><td>sRefset</td><td>The file conform to the single string reference set format.

## ContentSubType Element

The ContentSubType element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It provides additional information to describe the content and purpose of the file, including the language/ dialect, where appropriate. Its format is 2-48 alphanumeric characters in camel case (except for the capitalization rules specified below for languagecode). Hyphen (" **-** ") is a permitted character in conjunction with a language code, as described below.

## CountryNamespace Element

The CountryNamespace element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It identifies the organization responsible for developing and maintaining the file. It is a string of 2 to 10 alphanumeric characters consisting of the two sub-elements described below. At least one of these two sub-elements must be present. SNOMED International or a National Release Center (NRC) may optionally include both sub-elements where they consider this to be appropriate.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="126.80078125"></th><th width="113.953125"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sub-element</strong></td><td><strong>Values</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>CountryCode</td><td>INT</td><td>The file is maintained and distributed by SNOMED International.</td></tr><tr><td>CountryCode</td><td>AA <em>to</em> ZZ</td><td>The file is maintained and distributed by the NRC for the country represented by this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code</a>.

## VersionDate Element

The VersionDate element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It identifies the SNOMED CT version with which the file is intended to be used. Its format is an 8-digit number in the pattern "YYYYMMDD", in compliance with the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard.

* For Data Files(**sct** ,**der** or **res**), and for Documentation (**doc**) with a _status_ tag value of "**Current** ", the value of this element should always be the same as the SNOMED CT version date with which the file is associated.
* For other file types, the VersionDate element will identify the (past) date of the SNOMED CT release for which the file was intended. A file distributed with a past version date has not been updated to reflect changes to SNOMED CT since that date, nor has it been validated as correct or appropriate for current use.

## File Extension

The extension element of the filename identifies the file format (encoding convention) of the file, such as " **txt** ", " **pdf** " or " **zip** ". It has a format of 1-4 alphanumeric characters.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="94.6953125"></th><th width="84.04296875"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>FileType</strong></td><td><strong>Values</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>sct or der</td><td>txt</td><td>All RF2 formatted release files are distributed as plain text UTF-8 files with the .txt suffix.</td></tr><tr><td>doc</td><td>pdf</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> is the default format for documents distributed and made available for download in a format suitable for local viewing or printing.</td></tr><tr><td>doc</td><td>&#x3C;other></td><td>Other document formats including plain text (.txt) and HTML (.html) may be used where deemed appropriate. In all cases the file extension (suffix) used should be one of the widely recognized format. Unless there are exceptional requirements, the format should be accessible using freely available software.</td></tr><tr><td>res</td><td>txt</td><td>Most resources should be provided as plain text UTF-8 files with the .txt suffix.</td></tr><tr><td>res</td><td>zip</td><td>Where appropriate a resource file, or a collection of such files, may be distributed as zip archive.</td></tr><tr><td>res</td><td>&#x3C;other></td><td>Other data formats may be used where appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>tls</td><td>&#x3C;any></td><td>No specific statements are made about the file extsions to be used for tooling files. However, in general such tools should be provided in a format that does not compromise system security. In most cases, tools should be provided through an interface such as GitHub and should not be included as part of general releases of the terminology.</td></tr></tbody></table>
