# Release File Naming Convention

## Overall Naming Pattern

The basic pattern for SNOMED CT release file names consists of five elements, each separated by an underscore (" **\_** ") and followed by a full stop (" **.** ") and a file extension:

#### \[<mark style="color:blue;">FileType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">ContentType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">ContentSubType</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">CountryNamespace</mark>]\[<mark style="color:blue;">VersionDate</mark>].\[<mark style="color:blue;">FileExtension</mark>]

Each element in the above structure is described in more detail by table in the following section.

## FileType Element

The FileType element of the filename designates the type and intended use of the [release file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file) . It consists of a 3 to 5 alphanumeric code with letters in lowercase.

The code comprises the following three sub-elements. The Type sub-element is required in all cases, other elements are required where relevant and otherwise omitted.

\|---|---\
Status| | General release file\
x| Provisional release file (e.g. part of an \[alpha]\(https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/alpha+release+package "Glossary link: alpha release package") or \[beta release package]\(https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/beta+release+package "Glossary link: beta release package") ).\
z| Archival or unsupported file\
Type| sct| Terminology Data File\
der| Derivative Work Data File (e.g. Reference set release file)\
doc| Documentation\
res| Implementation Resource Data File (e.g. a data file not following a SNOMED CT standard release file format)\
tls| Implementation Resource Tool (e.g. scripts or other software made available to process a release file)\
Format| 1| Release Format 1\
2| Release Format 2| Not specific to a release version

## ContentType Element

The ContentSubType element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It describes the content and purpose of the file. It consists of 2-48 alphanumeric characters in camel case.

The content of this element depends on the first element (FileType) of the filename, as described below:

restls| The value of the ContentType element may be determined on a case-by-case basis but, in conjunction with the ContentSubType element, should be adequate to identify the content and purpose of the file.

## ContentSubType Element

The ContentSubType element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It provides additional information to describe the content and purpose of the file, including the [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language)/ [dialect](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/dialect), where appropriate. Its format is 2-48 alphanumeric characters in camel case (except for the capitalization rules specified below for [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language)code). Hyphen (" **-** ") is a permitted character in conjunction with a language code, as described below.

<figure><img src="../../3%20section/3.3%20naming-conventions-for-release-packages-and-files/plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Sub-elements</strong>| <strong>Values</strong>| <strong>Description</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

\|---|---\
Summary|\
\| An optional short camel case summary of the usage of the file. The value of this sub-element may be determined on a case-by-case basis but, in conjunction with the ContentType element, should be adequate to identify the content and purpose of the file.Examples:

* For references sets a brief indication about the type or purpose the reference set(s) in the file.

Note: If there is a summary the ReleaseType or DocStatus follows this Summary sub-element immediately without a space or other separator.\
ReleaseType| Full| The file contains the Full view of the components or refset members within its scope (i.e. every version ever released).\
Snapshot| The file contains the Snapshot view of the components or refset members within its scope (i.e. only the most recent version released).\
Delta| The file contains the Delta view of the components or refset members within its scope (i.e. only additions/changes since previous release).\
LanguageCode|\
\| Where it is necessary to specify the language or dialect used in a file, the appropriate language code must be included as the final sub-element of the ContentSubType. If a Summary or DocStatus sub-element is also included, the LanguageCode must be added after the last of those sub-elements and must be separated from it by a hyphen.**Representation of the LanguageCode** The language is specified with a 2 character [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) (e.g. es = Spanish, fr = French, da = Danish). If necessary, a dialect code is added after the language code and separated from it by a hyphen.Depending on the specificity required the dialect code comes from one of two sources:

* If the dialect is general to an entire country, the two-letter [ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) is used to specify the dialect (e.g. en-US = US English, en-GB British English)
* If dialect is less common or not country specific, the [IANA language subtag](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) should be used. Note this code consists strings of lower case letres letters. IANA is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

This approach follows Internet conventions.

Summary|\
\| An optional short camel case addition to the ContentType title.If there is a Summary the DocStatus follows this Summary sub-element immediately without a space or other separator.\
DocStatus| Current| The document is up-to-date and complete for the current release of SNOMED CT, as indicated by the VersionDate element.\
Draft| The document is a draft version; it may be incomplete and has not been approved in a final version.\
Review| The document has been released for review and comments from SNOMED International Members, Affiliates and other stakeholders.\
LanguageCode|\
\| Where it is necessary to specify the language or dialect used in a file, the appropriate language code must be included as the final sub-element of the ContentSubType.

## CountryNamespace Element

The CountryNamespace element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It identifies the organization responsible for developing and maintaining the file. It is a string of 2 to 10 alphanumeric characters consisting of the two sub-elements described below. At least one of these two sub-elements must be present. [SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International) or a [National Release Center (NRC](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/National+Release+Center)) may optionally include both sub-elements where they consider this to be appropriate.

\|---|---\
CountryCode| INT| The file is maintained and distributed by SNOMED International.\
AA \_to\_ ZZ| The file is maintained and distributed by the \[NRC]\(https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/National+Release+Center "Glossary link: National Release Center") for the country represented by this \[ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code]\(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2). The code consists of exactly two uppercase characters from the latin alphabet.| The file is maintained and released by an SNOMED CT extension provider that is not an NRC.\
NamespaceId| 0000000 \_to\_ 9999999| The file is maintained and released by an SNOMED CT extension provider that is not an NRC. In which case, this value is a 7 digit \[namespace identifier]\(https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace+identifier "Glossary link: namespace identifier") allocated to that organization by SNOMED International.The file is maintained and distributed by either SNOMED International or an NRC and the distributing organization has chosen to include the namespace identifier to indicate that this is part of a release restricted to content in a single namespace.| The file is maintained and distributed by either SNOMED International or an NRC and the distributing organization has not chosen to include the namespace identifier to indicate that this is part of a release restricted to content in a single namespace.

## VersionDate Element

The VersionDate element is mandatory for all FileTypes. It identifies the [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT) version with which the file is intended to be used. Its format is an 8-digit number in the pattern "YYYYMMDD", in compliance with the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard.

* For Data Files(**sct** ,**der** or **res**),and for Documentation (**doc**) with a _status_ tag value of "**Current** ", the value of this element should always be the same as the [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT) version date with which the file is associated.
* For other file types, the VersionDate element will identify the (past) date of the [SNOMED CT release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release) for which the file was intended. A file distributed with a past version date has not been updated to reflect changes to [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT) since that date, nor has it been validated as correct or appropriate for current use.

## File Extension

The extension element of the filename identifies the file format (encoding convention) of the file, such as " **txt** ", " **pdf** " or " **zip** ". It has a format of 1-4 alphanumeric characters.

<figure><img src="../../3%20section/3.3%20naming-conventions-for-release-packages-and-files/plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>FileType</strong>| <strong>Values</strong>| <strong>Description</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

\|---|---\
sct or der| txt| All RF2 formatted release files are distributed as plain text UTF-8 files with the .txt suffix.\
doc| pdf| \[Portable Document Format]\(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable\_Document\_Format) is the default format for documents distributed and made available for download in a format suitable for local viewing or printing.| Other document formats including plain text (.txt) and HTML (.html) may be used where deemed appropriate. In all cases the file extension (suffix) used should be one of the widely recognized format. Unless there are exceptional requirements, the format should be accessible using freely available software.\
res| txt| Most resources should be provided as plain text UTF-8 files with the .txt suffix.\
zip\
\| Where appropriate a resource file, or a collection of such files, may be distributed as zip archive.| Other data formats may be used where appropriate.\
tls| | No specific statements are made about the file extsions to be used for tooling files. However, in general such tools should be provided in a format that does not compromise system security. In most cases, tools should be provided through an interface such as GitHub and should not be included as part of general releases of the terminology.
