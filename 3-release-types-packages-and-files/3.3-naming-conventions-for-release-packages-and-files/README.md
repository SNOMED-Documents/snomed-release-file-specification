# 3.3 Naming Conventions for Release Packages and Files

The release file naming convention specified in this section applies to all [SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International) [release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file) starting with the January 2010 [International release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+release). The release package naming convention specified was added subsequently to provide additional clarity through a structured name applied to the folder (and zip archive name) containing a set of release files. This package naming convention first applied to releases by SNOMED International during 2017.

These naming specifications provides the following benefits:

* A consistent naming convention across the [International edition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+edition) and each [National edition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/National+edition).
* Predictable file naming, providing a stable structure for naming over time between releases.
* A standard way to identify the source country and [namespace](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace) of the organization responsible for a [release file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file).
* A consistent mechanism for representing version of release files and packages of release files.
* An human readable way to identify the content of a file, at a summary level.
* A mechanism for identifying the type of information stored in a [release file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file)(e.g. documentation, tooling, etc.).
* Guidance on file naming for [release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file) in non-English [extensions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension).
* Assurance that file names will be unique across the [International release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+release) and releases from individual [National release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/National+release) centers and across separate releases from each center over time.

Quality Assurance checks, performed during the [International release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+release) process, ensure that this naming convention is enforced. Equivalent checks should also be performed as part of each [National Release Center's](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/National+Release+Center's) release process.
