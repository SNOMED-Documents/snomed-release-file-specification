**Historical Note on Current and Previous Release File Formats**

The standard format in which  SNOMED CT has been distributed since 2012 is known as Release Format 2 (RF2). It was developed in response to extensive feedback on the original release file format, now known as Release Format 1 (RF1), in which SNOMED CT was distributed between its first release in 2002 and 2012. The RF1 format is now deprecated and no longer supported.
