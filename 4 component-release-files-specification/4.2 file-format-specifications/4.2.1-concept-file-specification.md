# 4.2.1 Concept File Specification

The [Concept File](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Concept+file "Reference term: Concept file") holds the clinical [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") that make up [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT"). A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is given meaning by its [Fully Specified Name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Fully+Specified+Name "Glossary link: Fully Specified Name"), which is held in the [Description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Description+file "Reference term: Description file"). A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") may be distinguished from or refined by association with other [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") using [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships"), which are held in the [Relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Relationship+file "Reference term: Relationship file").

[moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(\(field\)\)")| [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")| Identifies the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") version's module. Set to a [descendant](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/descendant "Glossary link: descendant") of [ 900000000000443000 | Module|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000443000 "900000000000443000 | Module |") within the metadata [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy").| YES| NO

Set to a [descendant](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/descendant "Glossary link: descendant") of [ 900000000000444006 | Definition status|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000444006 "900000000000444006 | Definition status |") in the metadata [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy").| YES| NO  
  
Only one [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") record with the same id field is current at any point in time. The current record will be the one with the most recent [effectiveTime](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/effectiveTime+\(field\) "Reference term: effectiveTime \(\(field\)\)") before or equal to the date under consideration. If the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") field of this record is false ('0'), then the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive") at that point in time.

When a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is made [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive"), the following operations take place:

  * A new row is added to the [Concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Concept "Glossary link: Concepts") file for the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"), with the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") flag set to [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive") and the [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(\(field\)\)") set to [primitive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive "Glossary link: primitive");

  * All [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") that have as source the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") to be inactivated will themselves be inactivated by adding a new row to the [Relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Relationship+file "Reference term: Relationship file") for each [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship"), with the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") flag set to [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive");

  * All [active descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active+description "Glossary link: active descriptions") associated with the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") will remain unchanged unless incorrect for the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept");

  * Rows will be added as needed to the [Historical Association Reference Sets](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=DOCTSG&title=4.2.3+Historical+Association+Reference+Sets), to model associations from the [inactive concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive+concept "Glossary link: inactive concept") to other [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts");

  * [Active descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Active+description "Glossary link: Active descriptions") that are still associated with the [inactive concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive+concept "Glossary link: inactive concept") will be added to the [ 900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000490003 "900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator reference set |") , with an associated value of [ 900000000000495008 | Concept non-current|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000495008 "900000000000495008 | Concept non-current |")
