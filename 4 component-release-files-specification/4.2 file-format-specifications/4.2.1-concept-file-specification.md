# Concept File Specification

The Concept File holds the clinical concepts that make up SNOMED CT. A concept is given meaning by its Fully Specified Name, which is held in the Description. A concept may be distinguished from or refined by association with other concepts using relationships, which are held in the Relationship.

Only one concept record with the same id field is current at any point in time. The current record will be the one with the most recent effectiveTime before or equal to the date under consideration. If the active field of this record is false ('0'), then the concept is inactive at that point in time.

When a concept is made inactive, the following operations take place:

* A new row is added to the Concepts file for the concept, with the active flag set to inactive and the definitionStatusId set to primitive;
* All relationships that have as source the concept to be inactivated will themselves be inactivated by adding a new row to the Relationship for each relationship, with the active flag set to inactive;
* All active descriptions associated with the concept will remain unchanged unless incorrect for the concept;
* Rows will be added as needed to the [Historical Association Reference Sets](../../5-reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2-reference-set-types/5.2.1-content-reference-sets/5.2.1.4-association-reference-set/5.2.5.1-historical-association-reference-sets.md), to model associations from the inactive concept to other concepts;
* Active descriptions that are still associated with the inactive concept will be added to the [900000000000490003 | Description inactivation indicator reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000490003) , with an associated value of [900000000000495008 | Concept non-current|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000495008)
