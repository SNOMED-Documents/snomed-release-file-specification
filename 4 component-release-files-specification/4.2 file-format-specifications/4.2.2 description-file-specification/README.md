Note that a specific version of a [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") is not directly bound to a specific version of the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") to which it applies. Which version of a [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") applies to a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") depends on its effectiveTime and the point in time at which it is accessed.| NO| NO

Note that this specifies a [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: language") level only, not a [dialect](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/dialect "Glossary link: dialect") or country code.| NO| NO  
[typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)")| [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")| Identifies whether the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") is [fully specified name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/fully+specified+name "Glossary link: fully specified name") a [synonym](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/synonym "Glossary link: synonym") or other [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") type. This field is set to a [child](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/child "Glossary link: child") of [ 900000000000446008 | Description type|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000446008 "900000000000446008 | Description type |") in the Metadata [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy").| NO| NO

For example, the [term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/term+\(field\)) may be completely case sensitive, case insensitive or initial letter case insensitive. This field will be set to a [child](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/child "Glossary link: child") of [ 900000000000447004 | Case significance|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000447004 "900000000000447004 | Case significance |") within the metadata [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy").| YES| NO  
  
Only one [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") record with the same id field will be current at any point in time. The current record will be the one with the most recent [effectiveTime](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/effectiveTime+\(field\) "Reference term: effectiveTime \(\(field\)\)") before or equal to the point in time under consideration.

If the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")field of this record is false ('0'), then the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description")is [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive")at that point in time. If the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")field is true ('1'), then the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description")is associated with the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept")identified by the conceptId field.

The conceptId field, the languageCode field and the [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)") field will not change between two rows with the same id, in other words they are immutable. Where a change is required to one of these fields, then the component will be inactivated (by appending a row with the same id and the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active")field set to false) and a another row will be added representing a new component with a new id. Only limited changes may be made to the [term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/term+\(field\)) field, as defined by editorial rules.

Each [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") will have at least one [active description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active+description "Glossary link: active description") with a [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)") of [ 900000000000013009 | synonym|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000013009 "900000000000013009 | synonym |") and at least one [active description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active+description "Glossary link: active description")with a [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)") of [ 900000000000003001 | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") .

Where a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") only has one [active description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active+description "Glossary link: active description") with a [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(\(field\)\)") of [ 900000000000003001 | Fully specified name|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000003001 "900000000000003001 | Fully specified name |") across all [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: language") codes within a release, then that [Description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Description "Glossary link: Description") can be taken as the [Fully Specified Name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Fully+Specified+Name "Glossary link: Fully Specified Name") for all [languages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: languages") and [dialects](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/dialect "Glossary link: dialects"), and need not be explicitly included in every [language](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/language "Glossary link: language") [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set") associated with that release.

The [term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/term+\(field\) "Reference term: term \(\(field\)\)") field will be restricted as follows:

  * to an overall maximum length of 32Kb;
  * to a maximum length, configurable for each [description type](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+type "Glossary link: description type")as defined in the [ 900000000000538005 | Description format reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000538005 "900000000000538005 | Description format reference set |") member associated with that [description type](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+type "Glossary link: description type")\- see the [Description Format Reference Set](5.2.4.3-Description-Format-Reference-Set_28739380.html) specifications document for more details.

  * Control characters (including TABs, CRs and LFs) will not appear in [ 900000000000540000 | Plain text|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000540000 "900000000000540000 | Plain text |") or [ 900000000000541001 | Limited HTML|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000541001 "900000000000541001 | Limited HTML |") format types.
