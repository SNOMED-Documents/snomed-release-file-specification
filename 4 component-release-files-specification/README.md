# Component Release Files Specification

This guide describes SNOMED CT Release Format 2 (RF2), to be used for official production releases of SNOMED CT. This format is not mandated for internal terminology development usage or as an interchange mechanism between terminology development systems. RF2 provides a format that is flexible, unambiguous and useful. It was designed to strengthen SNOMED CT by providing a simple and stable format that enables innovation through adaptations to cater for changing requirements.

The component release files are defined in the following sections:

* [Associations Between Release Files](4.1-associations-between-release-files.md)
* [File Format Specifications](<4.2 file-format-specifications/>)
* [Metadata Hierarchy](4.3-metadata-hierarchy.md)

{% hint style="info" %}

* Reference Set Specification (SNOMED International Proposed Specification , 31 July 2007);
* Alternate Release Format (proposed by NEHTA and their Australian Affiliates).
