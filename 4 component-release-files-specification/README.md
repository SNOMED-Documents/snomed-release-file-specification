# 4 Component Release Files Specification

This guide describes [SNOMED CT Release Format 2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+Release+Format+2 "Glossary link: SNOMED CT Release Format 2") ([RF2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/RF2 "Glossary link: RF2")), to be used for official production releases of [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT"). This format is not mandated for internal terminology development usage or as an interchange mechanism between terminology development systems. [RF2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/RF2 "Glossary link: RF2") provides a format that is flexible, unambiguous and useful. It was designed to strengthen [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") by providing a simple and stable format that enables innovation through adaptations to cater for changing requirements[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/4+Component+Release+Files+Specification#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") .

The component release files are defined in the following sections:
