# 4.1 Associations Between Release Files

# Associations between Component Files

The logical model of [associations](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/association "Glossary link: associations") between the components in the release files is shown in [Figure 4.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/4.1+Associations+Between+Release+Files#Figure-logical-relationships "Logical Relationships Between Component Files"). The component class represents columns present in all three component files. The individual classes (description, concept and relationship) only show the additional columns present in those files. The colored lines between descriptions and concepts and between relationships and concepts represent the link between the foreign keys (shown in bold) and the id of the concept. These provide the functional connections between components described in this document. The grey lines indicate additional links between columns that are populated with concept identifiers that provide enumerated values.

# A More Complete View of Release File Associations

[Figure 4.1-2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/4.1+Associations+Between+Release+Files#Figure-assoc-2019 "Associations between SNOMED CT Release Files") provides an extended view of the associations between release files following changes complete in July 2019 release of SNOMED CT[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/4.1+Associations+Between+Release+Files#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") . These changes enable SNOMED CT to use enhanced [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") features and resulted in a significant change to the way in which the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") are represented. However the changes but did not significantly affect the structure and associations between the main component files shown in [Figure 4.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/4.1+Associations+Between+Release+Files#Figure-logical-relationships "Logical Relationships Between Component Files")

# Detailed Notes of Release File Associations

Each [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is represented by a row in the [Concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Concept+file "Reference term: Concept file") and the concept is identified by the id column in that row. There can be more than one row with the same id but with different effectiveTime values, in which case each of these rows represents a version of that same concept. Thus each row represents a version of a clinical [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). 

Each [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") has two or more [descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") associated with it:

  * At least one [Fully Specified Name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Fully+Specified+Name "Glossary link: Fully Specified Name"); and

  * At least one [synonym](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/synonym "Glossary link: synonym").

Each [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description") is represented by a row in the [description file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/description+file "Reference term: description file") and is identified by the id column in that row. There can be more than one row with the same id but with different effectiveTime values, in which case each of these rows represents a version of that same description. Thus each row represents a version of a description. Each description applies to one concept to which it is linked by the conceptId. All versions of a description must relate to exactly the same identified concept (i.e. the conceptId must not change between versions).

Each [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship"), from a source [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") to a destination [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"), is represented by a row in the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file"). There can be more than one row with the same id but with different effectiveTime values, in which case each of these rows represents a version of that same relationship. Thus each row represents a version of a relationship. The source, destination and type each relationship are identified respectively by the sourceId, destinationId and typeId columns. All versions of a relationship must have the same sourceId, destinationId and typeId. The typeId refers to [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"), that is also held within the [concept file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/concept+file "Reference term: concept file"). The only concepts that can be used as the relationship typeId are [ 116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003 "116680003 | is a |") or concepts that are subtypes of [ 410662002 | Concept model attribute|](http://snomed.info/id/410662002 "410662002 | Concept model attribute |") .

The most basic form of [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") is the [ 116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003 "116680003 | is a |") relationship. This relationship states that one [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is a subtype of another [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). Each subtype concept is connected to its parent subtype(s) by relationships with the typeId [ 116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003 "116680003 | is a |") and this form the main SNOMED CT [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy"). In this [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy"), a [child](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/child "Glossary link: child")[concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") may have more than one parent [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). The root of the [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy") is [ 138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept|](http://snomed.info/id/138875005 "138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept |") , which has a set of top level [children](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/children "Glossary link: children"), each forming its own [sub-hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sub-hierarchy "Glossary link: sub-hierarchy").[Relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Relationship "Glossary link: Relationships") with typeid values that are subtypes of [ 410662002 | Concept model attribute|](http://snomed.info/id/410662002 "410662002 | Concept model attribute |") are referred to as attribute relationship and contribute to the formal definition of the source concept.
