# Owl Expression Reference Set file

A release file that follows the [OWL Expression Reference Set](<../../../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.1 content-reference-sets/5.2.1.9-owl-expression-reference-set.md>) pattern and contains expressions that represent general statements about the SNOMED CT ontology and axioms that define SNOMED CT concepts.

#### Notes

* The OWL expression reference set contains two reference sets, the OWL ontology reference set and the OWL axiom reference set.
