# Identifier file

The file structure used to distribute alternative Identifiers for SNOMED CT components.

Note: The Identifier file is not currently used in the [SNOMED CT International Release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+International+Release) as use of the more flexible  [5.2.3.1 Simple Map from SNOMED CT Reference Set](../../../5-reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2-reference-set-types/5.2.3-map-reference-sets/5.2.3.1-simple-map-from-snomed-ct-reference-set.md) / [5.2.3.2 Simple Map to SNOMED CT Reference Set](<../../../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.3 map-reference-sets/5.2.3.2-simple-map-to-snomed-ct-reference-set.md>) structures are preferred for links to/from alternative codes. The only known current use of this file is for internal identification of components during the content development process.
