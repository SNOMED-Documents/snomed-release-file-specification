# identifierSchemeId (field)

A field in the RF2 [Identifier file ](identifier-file.md)containing a SNOMED CT identifier which identifies the alternate code system.

Note: In practice, the identifier file is not used in the SNOMED CT International Release as the use of [Simple Map from SNOMED CT Reference Set ](../../../5-reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2-reference-set-types/5.2.3-map-reference-sets/5.2.3.1-simple-map-from-snomed-ct-reference-set.md)or [Simple Map to SNOMED CT Reference Set](<../../../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.3 map-reference-sets/5.2.3.2-simple-map-to-snomed-ct-reference-set.md>) is preferred. The only current use of this file is for internal identification during the development process.
