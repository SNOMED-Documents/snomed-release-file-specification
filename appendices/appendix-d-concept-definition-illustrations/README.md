# Appendix D: Concept Definition Illustrations

A concept definition is a set of one or more axioms that partially or sufficiently specify the meaning of a SNOMED CT concept.

### Notes

* _Concept definitions_ are represented in two ways in SNOMED CT release files:\
  \* As a stated view represented by axioms that conform to the OWL Functional Syntax distributed in the [OWL Expression Reference Set file](../appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/o/owl-expression-reference-set-file.md).\
  \* As an inferred view represented by defining relationships that are distributed in the relationship file. The _inferred view_ is generated by applying description logic classification to the _stated view_.
* _Concept definitions_ include two distinct elements
  * Axioms that assert that a concept is a subtype of one or more other concepts. In the inferred view these are represented as subtype relationships.
  * Axioms that assert characteristics of a concept that distinguish it from its supertypes. In the inferred view these are represented as attribute relationships.

This appendix illustrates some of the features of concept definitions outlined in section [Concept Definitions](<../../2 snomed-ct-logical-model/2.3 concept-definitions/>).
