# D.1 Stated and Inferred Definitions - Examples

The appendix contains an extended version of [Stated and Inferred Concept Definitions](<../../2 snomed-ct-logical-model/2.3 concept-definitions/2.3.1-stated-and-inferred-concept-definitions.md>) supported by more detailed examples.

## Stated View of Concept Definitions

SNOMED CT concepts are defined by assertions made by SNOMED CT authors. The concept definitions asserted by SNOMED CT authors are known as the stated view.

The stated view is a representation of concept definitions consisting only of assertions made or revised by SNOMED CT authors.

#### Notes

* In contrast to the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view), the _stated view_ does not include inferences generated by applying a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier).
* The _stated view_ is represented by axioms, that conform to the OWL functional syntax. These axioms are distributed in the [OWL axiom reference set file](../appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/o/owl-expression-reference-set-file.md).

## Description Logic Classification

A description logic classifier can apply logical rules to the stated view to create inferences. The end result of this process is an inferred view of concept definitions.

## Inferred Views of Concept Definitions

The inferred view is a representation of concept definitions that is logically derived by applying a description logic classifier to the stated view.

#### Notes

* Different _inferred views_ can be derived from the same [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) by applying different rules that selectively exclude some types of assertions.
* Different _inferred views_ may be semantically equivalent to one another provided that assertions are only excluded if they are redundant (i.e. can be _inferred_ from assertions that are included). However, in some cases, an _inferred view_ may not completely represent the concept definition but may serve a specific purpose.

## Illustration of the Effect of Classification

Table D.1-1 shows the stated view of the definitions of [710785000 |Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) . Compare this with the inferred view of the same concept in Table D.1-2 and you can see that the single supertype concept [71388002 |Procedure|](http://snomed.info/id/71388002) been replaced by four supertype concepts in the inferred view.

The classifier has compared the definition of [710785000 |Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) with the concept definitions shown in Tale D.1-3 and determined that [710785000 | Laparoscopic repair of hernia|](http://snomed.info/id/710785000) is a subtype of all these concepts.

In fact, the classifier will also have found several other supertypes but the inferred view distributed in the relationship file only includes proximal supertypes (parents). Other supertype ancestors are excluded from the file because they are redundant <sup>1</sup> .
