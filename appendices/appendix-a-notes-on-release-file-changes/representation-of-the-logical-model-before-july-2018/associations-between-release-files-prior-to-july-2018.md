# Associations Between Release Files Prior to July 2018

{% hint style="warning" %}
For details of the Stated Definition View since July 2019 please see [Associations Between Release Files](<../../../4 component-release-files-specification/4.1-associations-between-release-files.md>).
{% endhint %}

The [stated relationship file](../../appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/s/stated-relationship-file.md), was used to represent the stated view of relationships prior to a transition process between July 2018 and July 2019. In July 2019 this file became obsolete and was completely replaced by two [OWL Expression Reference Sets](<../../../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.1 content-reference-sets/5.2.1.9-owl-expression-reference-set.md>) (the OWL axiom reference set file and the OWL ontology reference set file).

Figure 1 shows the associations between files that represent the stated and inferred views prior to the transition. It shows the associations between the release files that following these changes.

The stated relationship file is now obsolete as it has been completely replaced by two [OWL Expression Reference Sets](../../appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/o/owl-expression-reference-set-file.md) (the OWL axiom reference set file and the OWL ontology reference set file).

During the transitional period the stated relationship file continued to be distributed, but the OWL axiom reference set introduced advanced aspects to concept definitions which could not be represented in the stated relationship file.
