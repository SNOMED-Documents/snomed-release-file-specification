# Representation of the Logical Model - Before July 2018

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is a historical record of the representation of the SNOMED CT Logical Model before July 2018. During a period of transition between July 2018 and July 2019 the model was revised to enable more advanced description logic axioms to be represented. The Logical model following those changes is shown in [Representation of the Logical Model](../../../logical-model/2.2-representation-of-the-logical-model.md)
{% endhint %}

Figure 1 shows how SNOMED CT release files prior to July 2018 represented the various elements in the logical model. The revised representation of these element is shown on in [Representation of the Logical Model](../../../logical-model/2.2-representation-of-the-logical-model.md): Figure 1.
