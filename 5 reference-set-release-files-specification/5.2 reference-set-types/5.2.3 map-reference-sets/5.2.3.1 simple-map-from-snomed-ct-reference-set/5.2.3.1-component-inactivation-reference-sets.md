# 5.2.3.1 Component Inactivation Reference Sets

The  _active_ field of each [component version](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component+version "Glossary link: component version") indicates whether a component is active or inactive. However, it does not provide any information about why a concept or description has been inactivated. The reason why a concept or description has been inactivated is indicated by a row in a component Inactivation [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set"). The reason for inactivation may determine the appropriate way to deal with data in existing records, protocols or queries that use a concept or description after it has been inactivated.

The two [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") inactivation [Reference Sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Reference+Set "Glossary link: Reference Sets") are shown in [Table 5.2.3.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.3.1+Component+Inactivation+Reference+Sets#Table-inactivation-refsets "Component Inactivation Reference Sets").

The reason for inactivation is specified by a [concept enumeration](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+enumeration "Glossary link: concept enumeration").

The permitted values for this enumeration for a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") are documented in the Editorial Guide pages on [Concept Inactivation](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCEG/Concept+Inactivation?src=sidebar), and the type of historical association that should be applied is also provided.
