# 5.2.5.1 Historical Association Reference Sets

# Purpose

Historical Association Reference Sets are used to link concepts that have been inactivated to active concepts that represent an identical, similar or possible meaning of the inactivated concept. 

Historical Association Reference Sets follow the release file specification documented in [5.2.1.4 Association Reference Set](5.2.1.4-Association-Reference-Set_28739378.html) with the inactive concept represented by the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(field\)"), the type of association represented by the [refsetId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/refsetId+\(field\) "Reference term: refsetId \(field\)") and the related active concept represented by the [targetComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/targetComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: targetComponentId \(field\)"). 

The following subsections identify the metadata used to represent different types of historical associations.
