# 5.1 Essential Concept Identifiers

[Terminology servers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Terminology+server "Glossary link: Terminology servers") should provide efficient access to the [Identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Identifier "Glossary link: Identifiers") that represent [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") with structurally significant [Roles](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Role "Glossary link: Roles") within the terminology. [Table 5.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.1+Essential+Concept+Identifiers#Table-essential-concept-identifiers "Essential concept Identifiers") lists the [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") that have the most clear-cut structurally significant [Roles](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Role "Glossary link: Roles"). A [terminology server](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/terminology+server "Glossary link: terminology server") should enable access to these [Identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Identifier "Glossary link: Identifiers") by an easy-to-use name or enumeration. In addition, a [terminology server](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/terminology+server "Glossary link: terminology server") should provide a service that rapidly determines whether a given [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") is a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtype") of any of these [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts"). It is also useful for the [terminology server](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/terminology+server "Glossary link: terminology server") to extend similar functionality to all direct [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes") of the [root concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/root+concept "Glossary link: root concept") ( [ 138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept|](http://snomed.info/id/138875005 "138875005 | SNOMED CT Concept |") ) and to [subtype descendants](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+descendant "Glossary link: subtype descendants") of [ 410662002 | concept model attribute|](http://snomed.info/id/410662002 "410662002 | concept model attribute |") .
