# 5.1.1 Basic Reference Set Member File Format

The basic [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set") data structure consists of the following fields: 

Table 5.1.1-1: Basic Reference Set Data Structure

**Field**| **Data type**| **Purpose**| **[Mutable](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Mutable "Glossary link: Mutable")**| **Part of Primary Key**  
---|---|---|---|---  
id| [UUID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/UUID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: UUID \(\(data type\)\)")| A 128 bit unsigned [Integer](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Integer+\(data+type\) "Reference term: Integer \(\(data type\)\)"), uniquely identifying this [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member").Different versions of a _reference set member_ share the same [id](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/id+\(field\) "Reference term: id \(\(field\)\)") but have different [effectiveTime](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/effectiveTime+\(field\) "Reference term: effectiveTime \(\(field\)\)"). This allows a _reference set member_ to be modified or made [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/inactive+\(field\) "Reference term: inactive \(field\)") (i.e. removed from the active set) at a specified time.   
| NO| YES (Full /Snapshot)

| YES| YES (Full)Optional (Snapshot)   
[active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/active+\(field\) "Reference term: active \(\(field\)\)")| [Boolean](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Boolean+\(data+type\) "Reference term: Boolean \(\(data type\)\)")| The state of the identified [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") as at the specified [effectiveTime](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/effectiveTime+\(field\) "Reference term: effectiveTime \(\(field\)\)") .If [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/active+\(field\) "Reference term: active \(\(field\)\)") = 1 (true) the [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") is part of the current version of the set, if [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/active+\(field\) "Reference term: active \(\(field\)\)") = 0 (false) the [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") is not part of the current version of the set.   
| YES| NO  
[moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(\(field\)\)")| [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")| Identifies the [SNOMED CT module](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+module "Glossary link: SNOMED CT module") that contains this [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member") as at the specified [effectiveTime](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/effectiveTime+\(field\) "Reference term: effectiveTime \(\(field\)\)") .The value must be a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtype") of [ 900000000000443000 | Module (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000443000 "900000000000443000 | Module \(core metadata concept\) |") within the metadata [hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/hierarchy "Glossary link: hierarchy").

| NO| NO  
[referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)")| [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")| A reference to the [SNOMED CT component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT component") to be included in the [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set").   
| NO| NO  
Zero or more other fields dependent on reference set type| [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)"), [String](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/String+\(data+type\) "Reference term: String \(\(data type\)\)"), or [Integer](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/Integer+\(data+type\))| Optional field(s) serving purposes specific to the reference set type. For details see [5.2 Reference Set Types](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/WIPRELFMT/5.2+Reference+Set+Types).| YES| NO  
  
Each [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set") is identified and named by a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") in the [metadata hierarchy](5.1.4-Metadata-Supporting-Reference-Sets_33490080.html). Therefore the reference set is identified by a concept identifier (an [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(data type\)")). 

Each row in a reference set file represents a [reference set member](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set+member "Glossary link: reference set member"). 

  * Individual reference set members are uniquely identified by a identifier represented as a [UUID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/UUID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: UUID \(\(data type\)\)"). 
  * Each reference set member belongs to a single reference set, and it is linked to that reference set by the [refsetId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/refsetId+\(field\) "Reference term: refsetId \(field\)") field. 
  * Each reference set member is also associated with a single referenced component by its [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)") field. The referenced component may be a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"), [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description"), [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship"). If the referenced component is a concept that identifies another reference set, that reference set may be considered to be the target of the reference. 
  * Like [components](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: components"), reference set members can be versioned to inactivate or change the status of the member. So there may be several rows in a [full release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/full+release "Glossary link: full release") file and in this case the one with the most recent effectiveTime before or equal to the point in time under consideration represents state of that reference set member. If the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") field of this row is false ('0'), then the reference set member is [inactive](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inactive "Glossary link: inactive") at that point in time, which means that component it refers to is not a member of the reference set. If the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") field is true ('1'), then the component referenced by the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)") field is deemed to be a member of the [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set"). 

The [refsetId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/refsetId+\(field\) "Reference term: refsetId \(\(field\)\)") and [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(\(field\)\)") fields will not change between two rows with the same id, in other words they are immutable. Where a change is required to one of these fields, the current row will be inactivated (by appending a row with the same id and the [active](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/active "Glossary link: active") field set to false). Another row with a new id will be appended to reference another component. 

A component may belong to any number of [reference sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference sets"). A component may also be referenced by more that one member of the same [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/reference+set "Glossary link: reference set"). This is not useful in the case of a simple reference set but is relevant for some reference sets. For example, a SNOMED CT concept may map to or from more than on codes in another code system.
