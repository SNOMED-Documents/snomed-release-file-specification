# 1. Introduction

## Background

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") is the most comprehensive and precise clinical health terminology product in the world. It has been developed collaboratively to ensure it meets the diverse needs and expectations of clinicians worldwide and is accepted as a common global language for health terms. SNOMED CT enables meaning-based retrieval and processing of clinical data because it applies [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") techniques to represent the meaning of clinical concepts. As a result, patients and healthcare professionals benefit from improved health records, clinical decisions and analysis, leading to higher quality, consistency and safety in healthcare delivery.

[SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International "Glossary link: SNOMED International") distributes SNOMED CT to its licensees as a package of [release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file "Glossary link: release files") that can be loaded into software applications that enable and optimize access to the terminology.
