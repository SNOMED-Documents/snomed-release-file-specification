{% hint style="info" %}
Prior to July 2018 the stated view of concept definitions were represented by relationships in the stated relationship file. During a transitional period between July 2018 and July 2019 the OWL reference sets were introduced. Since the end of that transitional period in July 2019, the stated relationship file is no longer maintained or distributed.\
The representation of the inferred view of concept definitions is unchanged from the perspective of the release file structure. However, the nature and quality of the inferred relationships changed as a result of inferences derived from the enhanced definitions represented as axioms in the OWL axiom reference set.\
More information on these changes is available in this document in Section [OWL Expression Reference Set](<../5 reference-set-release-files-specification/5.2 reference-set-types/5.2.1 content-reference-sets/5.2.1.9-owl-expression-reference-set.md>) and a historical note on [Representation of the Logical Model - Before July 2018](../appendixes/appendix-a-notes-on-release-file-changes/representation-of-the-logical-model-before-july-2018.md). Detailed information about the representation of SNOMED CT definitions using OWL axioms is provided by the [SNOMED CT OWL Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/UVgNFMSypqSsi48DpFEe/) and [SNOMED CT Logic Profile Specification](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/hRUJsLa2ant5L63pkp1O/).
