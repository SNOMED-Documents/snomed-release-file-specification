# 2.2 Representation of the Logical Model

[Figure 2.2-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/2.2+Representation+of+the+Logical+Model#Figure-model-post-update "Representation of the logical model of SNOMED CT") shows how SNOMED CT release files represent the logical model 1.

Table 2.2-1: Release file representation of the logical model

**Logical Model**| **Release File Representations**| **References**  
---|---|---  
**Concepts**|  Each concept is represented by a row in the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/concept+file "Reference term: concept file") release file.| [4.2.1 Concept File Specification](4.2.1-Concept-File-Specification_28739339.html)  
**Descriptions**|  Each description is represented by a row in the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/description+file "Reference term: description file") release file.| [4.2.2. Description File Specification](4.2.2.-Description-File-Specification_28739340.html)  
**Stated Concept Definitions**|  Each stated [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") is represented by a set of rows in the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file"), which follows the format of an [OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html). Each row contains an [axiom](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axiom") that forms part of the definition of the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") identified by the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(field\)").**Notes:**

  * As well as representing the definitions of individual concepts, the [OWL axiom reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file") represents characteristics of [attributes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/attribute "Glossary link: attributes") including transitivity, reflexivity and property chains.
  * The [OWL ontology reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+ontology+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL ontology reference set file") also follows the [OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html) pattern. It contains general information about the terminology, which is required by a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier") but is not subject to significant changes between release versions.

**Inferred Concept Definitions**|  Each inferred [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") is represented by a set of rows in the [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") release file. Each row in the set that defines a concept, represents a necessary, defining relationship with another concept. The [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") column in the concept file row indicates whether the set of defining relationships is sufficient to define the concept.| [4.2.3 Relationship File Specification](4.2.3-Relationship-File-Specification_28739341.html)  
**Other Related Information**|  Represented by a range of [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/reference+set+file "Reference term: reference set file") release files that conform to the extensible [reference set file format](5.1.1-Basic-Reference-Set-Member-File-Format_28739345.html).Each row in a reference set refers to a concept or description as a member of the set.The extensible structure allows different types of related information to be associated with the referenced component.| [5.2 Reference Set Types](5.2-Reference-Set-Types_28739366.html)[Practical Guide to Reference Sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRFSPG/Practical+Guide+to+Reference+Sets)

##### Footnotes

1

Prior to July 2018 the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of concept definitions were represented by relationships in the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file"). During a transitional period between July 2018 and July 2019 the OWL reference sets were introduced. Since the end of that transitional period in July 2019, the stated relationship file is no longer maintained or distributed.   
The representation of the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") of concept definitions is unchanged from the perspective of the release file structure. However, the nature and quality of the inferred relationships changed as a result of inferences derived from the enhanced definitions represented as axioms in the OWL axiom reference set.  
More information on these changes is available in this document in Section [5.2.1.9 OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html) and a historical note on [Representation of the Logical Model - Before July 2018](Representation-of-the-Logical-Model---Before-July-2018_71172638.html). Detailed information about the representation of SNOMED CT definitions using OWL axioms is provided by the [SNOMED CT OWL Guide](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL/SNOMED+CT+OWL+Guide) and [SNOMED CT Logic Profile Specification](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCLPS/SNOMED+CT+Logic+Profile+Specification).   
The SNOMED CT E-Learning Presentation [Updates to Support Advanced Description Logic](https://elearning.ihtsdotools.org/mod/scorm/view.php?id=2456) also provides an overview of the reasons for these changes.
