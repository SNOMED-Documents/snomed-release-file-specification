**Inferred Concept Definitions**| Each inferred [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) is represented by a set of rows in the [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file) release file. Each row in the set that defines a concept, represents a necessary, defining relationship with another concept. The [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\)) column in the concept file row indicates whether the set of defining relationships is sufficient to define the concept.| [4.2.3 Relationship File Specification](../2%20snomed-ct-logical-model/4.2.3-Relationship-File-Specification_28739341.html)\
**Other Related Information**| Represented by a range of [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/reference+set+file) release files that conform to the extensible [reference set file format](../2%20snomed-ct-logical-model/5.1.1-Basic-Reference-Set-Member-File-Format_28739345.html).Each row in a reference set refers to a concept or description as a member of the set.The extensible structure allows different types of related information to be associated with the referenced component.| [5.2 Reference Set Types](../2%20snomed-ct-logical-model/5.2-Reference-Set-Types_28739366.html)[Practical Guide to Reference Sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRFSPG/Practical+Guide+to+Reference+Sets)

Prior to July 2018 the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) of concept definitions were represented by relationships in the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file). During a transitional period between July 2018 and July 2019 the OWL reference sets were introduced. Since the end of that transitional period in July 2019, the stated relationship file is no longer maintained or distributed.\
The representation of the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) of concept definitions is unchanged from the perspective of the release file structure. However, the nature and quality of the inferred relationships changed as a result of inferences derived from the enhanced definitions represented as axioms in the OWL axiom reference set.\
More information on these changes is available in this document in Section [5.2.1.9 OWL Expression Reference Set](../2%20snomed-ct-logical-model/5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html) and a historical note on [Representation of the Logical Model - Before July 2018](../2%20snomed-ct-logical-model/Representation-of-the-Logical-Model---Before-July-2018_71172638.html). Detailed information about the representation of SNOMED CT definitions using OWL axioms is provided by the [SNOMED CT OWL Guide](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL/SNOMED+CT+OWL+Guide) and [SNOMED CT Logic Profile Specification](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCLPS/SNOMED+CT+Logic+Profile+Specification).\
The SNOMED CT E-Learning Presentation [Updates to Support Advanced Description Logic](https://elearning.ihtsdotools.org/mod/scorm/view.php?id=2456) also provides an overview of the reasons for these changes.
