# 2.3.2 Necessary Conditions and Sufficient Definitions

This section briefly outlines different aspects of assertions made about concepts and the extent to which they are necessarily true or form part of a sufficient definition of the concept. More detailed illustrations of some of the points on this page are provided in [D.2 Necessary and Sufficient - Examples](D.2-Necessary-and-Sufficient---Examples_71172658.html).

# Assertions

The [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") consists of one or more assertions made by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+author "Glossary link: SNOMED CT authors"). 

# Necessary Conditions

Each time an assertion is made about a concept, an [author](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/author "Glossary link: author") must decide if that assertion is a [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition"). If the assertion is always true for that concept and its [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes"), it is a [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition").

  * This implies that for all instances of that concept or its subtypes, the assertion must be true, even if it has not been explicitly stated.

* * *

A [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition") is defined as  a characteristic that is always true of a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). 

### Example

  * If you have a [ 71620000 | fracture of femur|](http://snomed.info/id/71620000 "71620000 | fracture of femur |") , the morphological abnormality [ 72704001 | fracture|](http://snomed.info/id/72704001 "72704001 | fracture |") must be present. Therefore,  [ 116676008 | morphology|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008 "116676008 | morphology |") = [ 72704001 | fracture|](http://snomed.info/id/72704001 "72704001 | fracture |") is a  _necessary condition_ of [ 71620000 | fracture of femur|](http://snomed.info/id/71620000 "71620000 | fracture of femur |") .

# Sufficient Definitions

For each [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") an [author](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/author "Glossary link: author") must decide if there are one or more sets of assertions that form a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") of that concept. A set of assertions is a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") if it distinguishes a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") and its subtypes from other concepts. 

  * This implies that if all assertions in the set are true for a concept, it must be an instance of the defined concept or a subtype of that concept.

* * *

A [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") is  a set of characteristics which distinguish a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") and its [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes") from all other [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts"). 

### Notes

  * Any concept that matches the  _sufficient definition_ is equivalent to or a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtype") of the defined concept.
  * A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") may have more than one  _sufficient definition_. In that case any concept that matches at least one of these  _sufficient definitions_ is equivalent to or a [subtype](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtype") of the defined concept.

### Examples

  * The following set of assertions is a sufficient definition for [ 74400008 | appendicitis (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/74400008 "74400008 | appendicitis \(disorder\) |") because any [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") for which this set of assertions is true must either be the disorder _appendicitis_ or a subtype of _appendicitis_.

[ 18526009 |disorder of appendix|](http://snomed.info/id/18526009 "18526009 | disorder of appendix |") +  
[ 302168000 |inflammation of large intestine|](http://snomed.info/id/302168000 "302168000 | inflammation of large intestine |") :  
[ 116676008 |associated morphology|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008 "116676008 | associated morphology |") =  [ 23583003 |inflammation|](http://snomed.info/id/23583003 "23583003 | inflammation |") ,  
[ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 66754008 |appendix structure|](http://snomed.info/id/66754008 "66754008 | appendix structure |")

  * Both the following sets of assertions are sufficient definitions for the concept [ 8801005 | Secondary diabetes mellitus (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/8801005 "8801005 | Secondary diabetes mellitus \(disorder\) |") :

[ 73211009 |Diabetes mellitus|](http://snomed.info/id/73211009 "73211009 | Diabetes mellitus |") : [ 246075003 |Causative agent|](http://snomed.info/id/246075003 "246075003 | Causative agent |") = [ 105590001 |Substance|](http://snomed.info/id/105590001 "105590001 | Substance |")

[ 73211009 |Diabetes mellitus|](http://snomed.info/id/73211009 "73211009 | Diabetes mellitus |") : [ 42752001 |Due to|](http://snomed.info/id/42752001 "42752001 | Due to |") = [ 64572001 |Disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | Disease |")

  * While each of the assertions  [ 246075003 | Causative agent|](http://snomed.info/id/246075003 "246075003 | Causative agent |") =  [ 105590001 | Substance|](http://snomed.info/id/105590001 "105590001 | Substance |") and  [ 42752001 | Due to|](http://snomed.info/id/42752001 "42752001 | Due to |") =  [ 64572001 | Disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | Disease |") form part of a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"), neither of these assertions are [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions") because  _only one_ of them needs to be true. This illustrates that an assertion that is part of a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") need not be a [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition").

# Concepts with no Sufficient Definitions

A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that has no [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions") is a [primitive concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive+concept "Glossary link: primitive concept"). 

Because [primitive concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive+concept "Glossary link: primitive concepts") have no [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions") it is not possible for a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier") to determine if other concepts are [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes") of this concept. Similarly, it is not possible to automatically determine whether an expression is a subtype of a primitive concept. Therefore, only concepts or expressions that explicitly state they are subtypes of primitive concepts will be treated as subtypes when applying expression constraints or undertaking analysis. 

However, note that this does not prevent a [primitive concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/primitive+concept "Glossary link: primitive concept") being classified as a subtype of a [sufficiently defined concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept "Glossary link: sufficiently defined concept"). 

# Concepts with a Sufficient Definition

A [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that has at least one [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") is a [sufficiently defined concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept "Glossary link: sufficiently defined concept"). 

A [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier") can determine whether the stated definitions of other concepts meet at least one of the [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions") and if so will classify these concepts as its [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes"). Similarly, it is possible to determine whether an expression is equivalent to or a subtype of a [sufficiently defined concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept "Glossary link: sufficiently defined concept"). Therefore, where expression constraints or queries refer to [sufficiently defined concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept "Glossary link: sufficiently defined concepts") the results will include the inferred subtypes of these concepts.

# Sufficiently Defined Concepts with Necessary Conditions

If a [sufficiently defined concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficiently+defined+concept "Glossary link: sufficiently defined concept") has one or more additional [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions") then any concept or expression that satisfies one of its [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions") will also inherit any [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions").

For example one sufficient definition of [ 397825006 | Gastric ulcer (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/397825006 "397825006 | Gastric ulcer \(disorder\) |") is an ulcer in a stomach structure:

===  [ 64572001 |disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | disease |") : {  [ 116676008 |associated morphology|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008 "116676008 | associated morphology |") =  [ 56208002 |ulcer|](http://snomed.info/id/56208002 "56208002 | ulcer |") ,   
[ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 69695003 |stomach structure|](http://snomed.info/id/69695003 "69695003 | stomach structure |") }

However, another definition could be created with a more specific site gastric mucosa:

===  [ 64572001 |disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | disease |") : {  [ 116676008 |associated morphology|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008 "116676008 | associated morphology |") =  [ 56208002 |ulcer|](http://snomed.info/id/56208002 "56208002 | ulcer |") ,   
[ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 78653002 |gastric mucosa|](http://snomed.info/id/78653002 "78653002 | gastric mucosa |") }

In both cases these definition are equivalent to [ 397825006 | Gastric ulcer (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/397825006 "397825006 | Gastric ulcer \(disorder\) |") . The more general definition is flexible when it comes to allowing refinement to a specific location of the ulcer within the stomach, which is actually useful information. It also avoids requiring an expression to refer specifically to the mucosa (stomach lining), which is where all gastric ulcers occur.

For example, an expression including the specific location could look like this

===  [ 64572001 |disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | disease |") : {  [ 116676008 |associated morphology|](http://snomed.info/id/116676008 "116676008 | associated morphology |") =  [ 56208002 |ulcer|](http://snomed.info/id/56208002 "56208002 | ulcer |") ,   
[ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 127869006 |Anterior wall of fundus of stomach|](http://snomed.info/id/127869006 "127869006 | Anterior wall of fundus of stomach |") }

This satisfies the sufficient definition because the finding site is a subtype of stomach structure. This will therefore classify as a type of [ 397825006 | Gastric ulcer (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/397825006 "397825006 | Gastric ulcer \(disorder\) |") located in the anterior wall of the gastric fundus. The problem is that a query for disorders of the gastric mucosa will not find this expression.

<< [ 64572001 |disease|](http://snomed.info/id/64572001 "64572001 | disease |") :  [ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 78653002 |gastric mucosa|](http://snomed.info/id/78653002 "78653002 | gastric mucosa |")

However, adding the definition that refers to the gastric mucosa as an additional [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition") can solve this problem. The expression satisfies the [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") implying this is a type of [ 397825006 | Gastric ulcer (disorder)|](http://snomed.info/id/397825006 "397825006 | Gastric ulcer \(disorder\) |") . The fact that it is a type of gastric ulcer causes it to inherit [ 363698007 | finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") =  [ 78653002 | gastric mucosa|](http://snomed.info/id/78653002 "78653002 | gastric mucosa |") so it will now be included in the query for disease in the gastric mucosa.
