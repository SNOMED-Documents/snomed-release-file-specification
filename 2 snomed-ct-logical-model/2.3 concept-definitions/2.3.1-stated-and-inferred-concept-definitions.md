# Stated and Inferred Concept Definitions

This section briefly outlines two distinct types of views of SNOMED CT concept definitions. More detailed illustrations of some of the points on this page are provided in [Stated and Inferred Definitions - Examples](../../appendixes/appendix-d-concept-definition-illustrations/d1-stated-and-inferred-definitions-examples.md).

## Stated View of Concept Definitions

SNOMED CT concepts are defined by assertions made by SNOMED CT authors. The concept definitions asserted by SNOMED CT authors are known as the stated view.

The stated view is a representation of concept definitions consisting only of assertions made or revised by SNOMED CT authors.

#### Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Notes

* In contrast to the inferred view, the _stated view_ does not include inferences generated by applying a description logic classifier.
* The _stated view_ is represented by axioms, that conform to the OWL functional syntax. These axioms are distributed in the OWL axiom reference set file
{% endhint %}

## Description Logic Classification

A description logic classifier can apply logical rules to the stated view to create inferences. The end result of this process is an inferred view of concept definitions.

## Inferred Views of Concept Definitions

The inferred view is a representation of concept definitions that is logically derived by applying a description logic classifier to the stated view.

#### Notes

* Different _inferred views_ can be derived from the same [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) by applying different rules that selectively exclude some types of assertions.
* Different _inferred views_ may be [semantically equivalent](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/semantic+equivalence) to one another provided that assertions are only excluded if they are redundant (i.e. can be _inferred_ from assertions that are included). However, in some cases, an _inferred view_ may not completely represent the [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition) but may serve a specific purpose.

## Choosing the View to Use

The decision on whether you need access to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view) and/or [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view) depends on your answers to the following questions.

However, the rules for [Generating Necessary Normal Form](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL/2.5.+Generating+Necessary+Normal+Form+Relationships+from+the+OWL+Refsets) take account of the need to omit more advanced features that cannot be represented as [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship). |
