# 2.3.1 Stated and Inferred Concept Definitions

This section briefly outlines two distinct types of views of [SNOMED CT concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept+definition "Glossary link: SNOMED CT concept definitions"). More detailed illustrations of some of the points on this page are provided in [D.1 Stated and Inferred Definitions - Examples](D.1-Stated-and-Inferred-Definitions---Examples_71172657.html).

# Stated View of Concept Definitions

[SNOMED CT concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+concept "Glossary link: SNOMED CT concepts") are defined by assertions made by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+author "Glossary link: SNOMED CT authors"). The [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") asserted by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+author "Glossary link: SNOMED CT authors") are known as the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view").

The [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") is a representation of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") consisting only of assertions made or revised by [SNOMED CT authors](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT author "Glossary link: SNOMED CT authors"). 

### Notes

  * In contrast to the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view"), the  _stated view_ does not include inferences generated by applying a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier").
  * The  _stated view_ is represented by [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axioms"), that conform to the [OWL functional syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+functional+syntax "Glossary link: OWL functional syntax"). These [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axioms") are distributed in the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file")

# Description Logic Classification

A [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier") can apply logical rules to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") to create inferences. The end result of this process is an [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions").

# Inferred Views of Concept Definitions

The [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") is a representation of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") that is logically derived by applying a [description logic classifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic+classifier "Glossary link: description logic classifier") to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view"). 

### Notes

  * Different  _inferred views_ can be derived from the same [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") by applying different rules that selectively exclude some types of assertions. 
  * Different  _inferred views_ may be [semantically equivalent](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/semantic+equivalence "Glossary link: semantic equivalence") to one another provided that assertions are only excluded if they are redundant (i.e. can be  _inferred_ from assertions that are included). However, in some cases, an  _inferred view_ may not completely represent the [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") but may serve a specific purpose.

  

# Choosing the View to Use

The decision on whether you need access to the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") and/or [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") depends on your answers to the following questions.

However, the rules for [Generating Necessary Normal Form](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL/2.5.+Generating+Necessary+Normal+Form+Relationships+from+the+OWL+Refsets) take account of the need to omit more advanced features that cannot be represented as [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships").
