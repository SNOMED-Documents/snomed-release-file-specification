# 2.3 Concept Definitions

Prior to the 31 July 2018 release, documentation about [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") focused on the central role of [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships"). Updates to enable the use of more advanced [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") features mean that some aspects of concept definitions cannot be fully represented by [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships"). Therefore, this section introduces and adopts a new focus on [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") and the assertions (or [axioms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/axiom "Glossary link: axioms")) that form the building blocks of these definitions. 

  * On completion of the updates, the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") will be deprecated. From that point forward the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file") will be the standard distribution file for the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions"). 
  * The [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") will continue to be used to distribute the [inferred view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions").

This section outlines some of the features of concept definitions and the impact of different ways of representing concept definitions on the precision and completeness of those definitions. This section has been kept as brief as possible and is only intended to raise awareness of the changes. For those interested in understanding more about each of the topics mentioned, a more detailed appendix is provided which illustrates each of the points made in this section.
