# 2.3.3 Additional Logic Features

Several [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") features, which would improve the completeness and precision of classification, cannot be represented in individual [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions").

# Property Characteristics

If particular characteristics of the [attributes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/attribute "Glossary link: attributes") used to define concepts are identified, this can enhance classification. For example, knowing that an attribute like [ 123005000 | Part of|](http://snomed.info/id/123005000 "123005000 | Part of |") is transitive would allow the classifier to make infer that an entire finger is part of the entire upper limb.

# Property Chains

Property chains are in some ways similar to transitivity but involve more than one attribute. For example, [ 127489000 | Has active ingredient|](http://snomed.info/id/127489000 "127489000 | Has active ingredient |") could be declared to chain with [ 738774007 | Is modification of|](http://snomed.info/id/738774007 "738774007 | Is modification of |") . In that case, suppose the definition of [ 387307005 | Calcium carbonate|](http://snomed.info/id/387307005 "387307005 | Calcium carbonate |") includes [ 738774007 | Is modification of|](http://snomed.info/id/738774007 "738774007 | Is modification of |") of [ 5540006 | Calcium|](http://snomed.info/id/5540006 "5540006 | Calcium |") , a DL classifier can determine that a tablet that [ 127489000 | Has active ingredient|](http://snomed.info/id/127489000 "127489000 | Has active ingredient |") = [ 387307005 | Calcium carbonate|](http://snomed.info/id/387307005 "387307005 | Calcium carbonate |") by definition has a modification of [ 5540006 | Calcium|](http://snomed.info/id/5540006 "5540006 | Calcium |") as its active ingredient. Thus in the example shown the classifier can determine that [ | calcium carbonate tablet|](http://snomed.org/fictid# "\(eg:\)  | calcium carbonate tablet |") is a subtype of [ | calcium tablet|](http://snomed.org/fictid# "\(eg:\)  | calcium tablet |") .
