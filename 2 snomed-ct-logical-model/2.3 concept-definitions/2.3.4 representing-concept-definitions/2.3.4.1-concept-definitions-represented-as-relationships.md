# 2.3.4.1 Concept Definitions Represented as Relationships

Between the first release of SNOMED CT in 2002 and 2018 both [stated](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") and [inferred views](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/inferred+view "Glossary link: inferred views") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") were distributed as [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships") in the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") and the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file"). 

As illustrated in [Figure 2.3.4.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/2.3.4.1+Concept+Definitions+Represented+as+Relationships#Figure-relationship-diagram "Diagrammatic representation of use of relationships to represent a concept definition"), each [defining relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationship") is represented by a row in the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file"). The [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") being defined is referenced by the [sourceId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/sourceId+\(field\) "Reference term: sourceId \(field\)"), the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that represents the type of relationship (attribute) is referenced by the [typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(field\)") and the [destinationId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/destinationId+\(field\) "Reference term: destinationId \(field\)") refers to the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") that represents the value of that attribute. 

The [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") also has a [relationshipGroup](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationshipGroup+\(field\) "Reference term: relationshipGroup \(field\)") which allows two or more [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships") to be grouped together. 

The [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") of the source concept, indicates whether the combination of [defining relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/defining+relationship "Glossary link: defining relationships") provide provides [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") of that concept.

# Limitations of Relationships for Representing Concept Definitions

Section [2.3.2 Necessary Conditions and Sufficient Definitions](2.3.2-Necessary-Conditions-and-Sufficient-Definitions_33490089.html), illustrated the following three points, which are not supported by the current use of [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") to represent [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions"): 

  1. A concept may have more than one [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"). 
     * Use of [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") only supports representation of a single [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") for each concept. If a concept is marked as sufficiently defined, all it relationships are considered to be part of its [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"). 
  2. A concept may have a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") that includes some assertions that are not [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions")  

     * Relationships are all assumed to be necessarily true.
  3. Some [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions") may not be part of a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"). 
     * Including these additional [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions") may cause some valid subtypes concepts (or expressions) to be omitted from the results of classification. 

Section [2.3.3 Additional Logic Features](2.3.3-Additional-Logic-Features_71172652.html), identifies other useful features that are supported by [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") tools but cannot be represented using only SNOMED CT. 

# Benefits of Relationships for Representing Concept Definitions

Relationships can be distributed in an easy to understand relational file structure. The [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") has been an established part of the standard set of SNOMED CT release files since the first release in 2002, with a revision in 2011-2012 to use [RF2](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/RF2 "Glossary link: RF2") to enhance versioning capabilities. Relationships can be retrieved, displayed and processed using widely understood techniques such as [SQL](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SQL "Glossary link: SQL") making it easy to join the relationships to the concepts to which they relate. 

# Future Use of Relationships for Representing Concept Definitions

## Stated Relationships to be Deprecated

The [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") needs to be enhanced to allow more flexible and expressive use of description logic. The structure of the relationship file is not suitable for this and a decision has been made to adopt the [OWL Functional Syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+Functional+Syntax "Glossary link: OWL Functional Syntax") so that new DL features can be added over time. As a result, at the end of the current transition period (during 2019), update, the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") with be deprecated. 

Information about the new representation for the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") is included in section [2.3.4.2 Concept Definitions Represented in OWL](2.3.4.2-Concept-Definitions-Represented-in-OWL_71172646.html). 

## Relationships Used for Inferred View Only

The current [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") will continue to be released containing the inferred view. Due to limitations of the [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") format, the inferred definitions will not contain the more sophisticated DL features. The [relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file"): 

  * will only contain [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions")
  * it will not distinguish between multiple [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions")
  * it will whether each [necessary condition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary condition") is part of any of the [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions"). 

Nevertheless, the end result will still be a more complete and precise than the current content of this file. The reason for this is that the inferred relationships in the file will be be generated by processing the enhanced stated view. Details of the way the inferred relationship are generated from the stated view are document in [2.5. Generating Necessary Normal Form Relationships from the OWL Refsets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL/2.5.+Generating+Necessary+Normal+Form+Relationships+from+the+OWL+Refsets).
