# 2.3.4.2 Concept Definitions Represented in OWL

This section outlines the rationale for distributing an OWL representation of the [stated view](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/stated+view "Glossary link: stated view") of [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") and provides an overview of the way OWL axioms are represented in [SNOMED CT release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+release+file "Glossary link: SNOMED CT release files"). More detailed information is published separately in the [SNOMED CT OWL Guide](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCOWL) and the [SNOMED CT Logic Profile Specification](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCLPS). 

# Rationale for Using OWL

The mismatch between the requirements for representing enhanced [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") and the capabilities of the current [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") might in theory be addressed by addition of columns to the file or adding additional information in reference sets. However, in practice this would create a more complex solution able to support a specific set of enhanced features. 

Adopting the well-established OWL standards formats offers a more flexible solution that can represent the full range of [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") features. This approach enables [SNOMED Internation](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+Internation "Glossary link: SNOMED Internation") to specify a particular logic profile to be applied to current releases of [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT"), with the option to extend that profile in the future. Future revisions of the logic profile would not require a change in the distribution file structure provided these were supported by an OWL syntax. 

# OWL Axioms

OWL axioms can be represented using several different syntaxes. SNOMED International has chose the [OWL Functional Syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+Functional+Syntax "Glossary link: OWL Functional Syntax") as its standard representation. 

The [OWL Functional Syntax](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/OWL+Functional+Syntax "Glossary link: OWL Functional Syntax") is  a formal representation of the web ontology language (_OWL_) as a simple text base syntax that is used as a bridge between the structural specification and various concrete syntaxes.

# OWL Expression Axiom Set

OWL axioms are distributed in a [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/reference+set+\(field\) "Reference term: reference set \(field\)") that follows the [OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html) specification. The axiom itself is contained in a string field and the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") whose definition it contributes to is referenced by the the [referencedComponentId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/referencedComponentId+\(field\) "Reference term: referencedComponentId \(field\)"). Although a single row in the reference set can provide a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"), the definition of a single concept can also include several axioms each represented by a row in the reference set.

As shown by this example, a single [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition") is represented by a single row in the reference set. However, some [concept definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definitions") may require multiple rows in the reference set. Situations in which multiple row are required include: 

  * Concepts with multiple [sufficient definitions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definitions"), each of which requires a separate row in the reference set. 
  * Concepts with additional [necessary conditions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/necessary+condition "Glossary link: necessary conditions") that are not part of a [sufficient definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/sufficient+definition "Glossary link: sufficient definition"), each of which requires a separate row in the reference set.
