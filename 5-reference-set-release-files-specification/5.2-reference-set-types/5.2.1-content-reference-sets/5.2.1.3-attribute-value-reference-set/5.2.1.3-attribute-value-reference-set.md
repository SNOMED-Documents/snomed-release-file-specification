# Component Inactivation Reference Sets

The _active_ field of each component version indicates whether a component is active or inactive. However, it does not provide any information about why a concept or description has been inactivated. The reason why a concept or description has been inactivated is indicated by a row in a component Inactivation reference set.  The reason for inactivation may determine the appropriate way to deal with data in existing records, protocols or queries that use a concept or description after it has been inactivated.

The two component inactivation Reference Sets are shown in the table below.

***

The reason for inactivation is specified by a concept enumeration.

The permitted values for this enumeration for a concept are documented in the Editorial Guide pages on Concept Inactivation, and the type of historical association that should be applied is also provided.

Additionally, the inactivation reasons that may be stated for description inactivation are documented in this page: Description Inactivation
