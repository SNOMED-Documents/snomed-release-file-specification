# Historical Association Reference Sets

## Purpose

Historical Association Reference Sets are used to link concepts that have been inactivated to active concepts that represent an identical, similar or possible meaning of the inactivated concept.

Historical Association Reference Sets follow the release file specification documented in [5.2.1.4 Association Reference Set](./) with the inactive concept represented by the referencedComponentId, the type of association represented by the refsetId and the related active concept represented by the targetComponentId.

The following subsections identify the metadata used to represent different types of historical associations.

## Metadata

The following metadata supports this reference set:

## Historical Association Rules and Guidance

Each member of a [900000000000522004 |Historical association|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000522004) Reference Set represents a reference from an inactive component to other equivalent or related components that were current in the Release Version in which that component was inactivated.

Each [|Historical association|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000522004) reference set represents a different type of association between the components referred to by the referencedComponentId and the targetComponentId as shown in Table 5.2.5.1-2.

The component identified by the targetComponentId must be an instance of the same class of component as the component identified by the referencedComponentId for all Historical association reference sets apart from the <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>REFERS TO concept association reference set<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>.

## Reference Set Descriptor and Example Data

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes on the tables used to show descriptors and examples**

The reference set example tables on this page have been revised as follows to aid clarity and understanding:

* The first four columns which are present in all release files are not shown. The omitted columns (id, effectiveTime, active, moduleId) are used in the same way in all referenced sets to support identification, versioning and packaging. They do not directly affect the specific features of a particular reference set or reference set type.
* Reference set columns that contain SNOMED CT identifiers are expanded to show details of the concept or description referenced by that identifier. In some cases, the term is shown in the same column using the expression syntax, in other cases an additional column with a name suffix '\_term' has been added. In the standard reference set files only the identifier is present in the column and there is no added column for the term. When using reference sets, the term and other details of the component are looked up from the relevant component release files.

### Descriptor Template

The tables below show examples of the descriptors for specific reference sets that follow the [|Association type reference set|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000521006) pattern.
