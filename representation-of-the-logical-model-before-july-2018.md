# Representation of the Logical Model - Before July 2018

[Figure 1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/Representation+of+the+Logical+Model+-+Before+July+2018#Figure-relfiles-pre-update "Practical representation of the logical model of SNOMED CT \(before update\)") shows how SNOMED CT release files prior to July 2018 represented the various elements in the logical model. The revised representation of these element is shown on in [2.2 Representation of the Logical Model: Figure 1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/2.2+Representation+of+the+Logical+Model#Figure-model-post-update "2.2 Representation of the Logical Model").

**Logical Model**| **Release File Representation**| **References**  
---|---|---  
**Concepts**|  Each concept is represented by a row in the [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/concept+file "Reference term: concept file") release file.| [4.2.1 Concept File Specification](4.2.1-Concept-File-Specification_28739339.html)  
**Descriptions**|  Each description is represented by a row in the [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/description+file "Reference term: description file") release file.| [4.2.2. Description File Specification](4.2.2.-Description-File-Specification_28739340.html)  
**Stated Concept Definitions**|  Each stated [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") is represented by a set of rows in the [stated relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") release file. Each row in the set that set defines a concept, represents a defining relationship with another concept. The [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") column in the concept file row indicates whether the set of defining relationships is sufficient to define the concept.The [stated relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") file has the same format as the relationship file.| [4.2.3 Relationship File Specification](4.2.3-Relationship-File-Specification_28739341.html)[Stated Relationship file](Stated-Relationship-file_28739310.html)  
**Inferred Concept Definitions**|  Each inferred [concept definition](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+definition "Glossary link: concept definition") is represented by a set of rows in the[relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/relationship+file "Reference term: relationship file") release file. Each row in the set that set defines a concept, represents a defining relationship with another concept. The [definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") column in the concept file row indicates whether the set of defining relationships is sufficient to define the concept.| [4.2.3 Relationship File Specification](4.2.3-Relationship-File-Specification_28739341.html)  
**Other Related Information**|  Represented by a range of [reference set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/reference+set+file "Reference term: reference set file") release files that conform to the extensible [reference set file format](5.1.1-Basic-Reference-Set-Member-File-Format_28739345.html).Each row in a reference set refers to a concept or description as a member of the set. The extensible structure allows different types of related information to be associated with the referenced component.| [5.2 Reference Set Types](5.2-Reference-Set-Types_28739366.html)[Practical Guide to Reference Sets](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRFSPG/Practical+Guide+to+Reference+Sets)
