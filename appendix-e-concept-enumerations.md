# Appendix E: Concept Enumerations

[SNOMED CT core](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+core "Glossary link: SNOMED CT core") _components_ have some fields that have values represented by [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") in specific parts of the [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") hierarchy. These are referred to as _concept_ enumerations.

The range of permitted values for each of the _concept_ enumerations is the set of [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes") of a specified _concept_ which is itself a _subtype_ of [ 900000000000442005 | Core metadata concept (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000442005 "900000000000442005 | Core metadata concept \(core metadata concept\) |") . The current set of _concept_ enumeration types is shown in [Table Appendix E:-1](/display/DOCRELFMT/Appendix+E:+Concept+Enumerations#Table-concept-table-core "Core metadata concept \(core metadata concept\) \(900000000000442005\)"). The values of each of these and the ways they should be used in implemented systems are described in the following subsections. 

Table Appendix E:-1: Core metadata concept (core metadata concept) (900000000000442005)

**Concept**| **Comment**  
---|---  
[ 900000000000443000 | Module (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000443000 "900000000000443000 | Module \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a development module. These _concepts_ provide values to the [moduleId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/moduleId+\(field\) "Reference term: moduleId \(field\)") field that is present in all _component_ release files. The value indicates the _module_ within which a [component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/component "Glossary link: component") was created and is being maintained.  
[ 900000000000444006 | Definition status (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000444006 "900000000000444006 | Definition status \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the concept.[definitionStatusId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/definitionStatusId+\(field\) "Reference term: definitionStatusId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate whether the current set of defining [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") applied to a _concept_ are sufficient to define it relative to its supertypes.  
[ 900000000000446008 | Description type (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000446008 "900000000000446008 | Description type \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the description.[typeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/typeId+\(field\) "Reference term: typeId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate whether the _description_ represents a [fully specified name](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/fully+specified+name "Glossary link: fully specified name"), a [synonym](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/synonym "Glossary link: synonym"), a text definition or some other symbolic or textual representation of the associated _concept_.  
[ 900000000000447004 | Case significance (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000447004 "900000000000447004 | Case significance \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the description.[caseSignificanceId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/caseSignificanceId+\(field\) "Reference term: caseSignificanceId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate whether the text of the _term_ can be modified to by switching characters from upper to lower case (or vice-versa).  
[ 900000000000449001 | Characteristic type (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000449001 "900000000000449001 | Characteristic type \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the relationship.[characteristicTypeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/characteristicTypeId+\(field\) "Reference term: characteristicTypeId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate whether a _relationship_ forms part of the definition of the source _concept_.  
[ 900000000000450001 | Modifier (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000450001 "900000000000450001 | Modifier \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the relationship.[modifierId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/modifierId+\(field\) "Reference term: modifierId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate the type of [description logic](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description+logic "Glossary link: description logic") (DL) restriction (some, all, etc.) that applies to the _relationship._  
[ 900000000000453004 | Identifier scheme (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000453004 "900000000000453004 | Identifier scheme \(core metadata concept\) |") | Each _subtype_ of this _concept_ represents a value that can be applied to the identifier.[identifierSchemeId](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/identifierSchemeId+\(field\) "Reference term: identifierSchemeId \(field\)") field. This is used to indicate the scheme to which the identifier value belongs.  
  
Note: Many of the concept enumerations include values that significantly impact the meaning or use of a _component_. Therefore, implementers may find it necessary to partially hard-code the way their systems process particular values. In these cases, the _concept_ referenced by the value is only of value when there is a requirement to display a human readable rending of the value. The main exceptions to this are [ 900000000000443000 | Module (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000443000 "900000000000443000 | Module \(core metadata concept\) |") and [ 900000000000453004 | Identifier scheme (core metadata concept)|](http://snomed.info/id/900000000000453004 "900000000000453004 | Identifier scheme \(core metadata concept\) |") both of which represent extensible sets of values as new modules or alternative _identifier_ schemes may be added in local [Extensions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Extension "Glossary link: Extensions") .
