# Associations Between Release Files Prior to July 2018

The [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file"), was used to represent the stated view of relationships prior to a transition process between July 2018 and July 2019. In July 2019 this file became obsolete and was completely replaced by two [OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html)s (the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file") and the [OWL ontology reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+ontology+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL ontology reference set file")).

The [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") is now obsolete as it has been completely replaced by two [OWL Expression Reference Set](5.2.1.9-OWL-Expression-Reference-Set_66486617.html)s (the [OWL axiom reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+axiom+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL axiom reference set file") and the [OWL ontology reference set file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/OWL+ontology+reference+set+file "Reference term: OWL ontology reference set file")). 

During the transitional period the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file") continued to be distributed, but the OWL axiom reference set introduced advanced aspects to concept definitions which could not be represented in the [stated relationship file](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/stated+relationship+file "Reference term: stated relationship file").
