# Item-Identifier Digits

The string of digits to the left of the partition-identifier (in a _short format_ [SCTID](../appendices/appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/s/sctid-data-type.md)) or to the left of the namespace-identifier (in a _long format_ SCTID) is referred to as the _item-identifier_.

These values are available to uniquely identify an individual entity within the specified partition or namespace. The same _item-identifier_ can be allocated in each partition of each namespace as the SCTID is rendered unique by the partition-identifier and the namespace-identifier. For components in the International Release of SNOMED CT, _item-identifiers_ will usually be issued in the arbitrary order in which components are added to SNOMED Clinical Terms. However, due to management of the editing process the sequence of issued _item-identifiers_ may be discontinuous.



{% hint style="danger" %}
CAUTION:  In all cases, the value of an _item-identifier_ on its own is meaningless. The only way to determine the meaning of an SCTID is by looking up the complete value in an appropriate distribution file.
