# 6.7 Item-Identifier Digits

The string of digits to the left of the [partition-identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/partition-identifier "Glossary link: partition-identifier")(in a _short format_[SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")) or to the left of the [namespace-identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace-identifier "Glossary link: namespace-identifier")(in a _long format_[SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)")) is referred to as the _item-identifier_. 

These values are available to uniquely identify an individual entity within the specified partition or namespace. The same _item-identifier_ can be allocated in each partition of each namespace as the [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)") is rendered unique by the [partition-identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/partition-identifier "Glossary link: partition-identifier") and the [namespace-identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace-identifier "Glossary link: namespace-identifier"). For components in the [International Release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+Release "Glossary link: International Release") of [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT"), _item-identifiers_ will usually be issued in the arbitrary order in which components are added to [SNOMED Clinical Terms](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+Clinical+Terms "Glossary link: SNOMED Clinical Terms"). However, due to management of the editing process the sequence of issued _item-identifiers_ may be discontinuous. 

CAUTION:

In all cases, the value of an  _item-identifier_ on its own is meaningless. The only way to determine the meaning of an [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)") is by looking up the complete value in an appropriate distribution file.
