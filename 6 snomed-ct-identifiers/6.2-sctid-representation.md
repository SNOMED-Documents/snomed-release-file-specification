# 6.2 SCTID Representation

Each [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)") identifies a [SNOMED CT component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT component"). The identifier itself does not contain information related to the meaning of a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") or [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description"). This means it is not possible to infer anything about the meaning of a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") from the numeric value of the identifier or from the sequence of digits. The meaning of a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") can be determined from [relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationships") to other [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") and from associated [descriptions](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: descriptions") that include human readable terms. 

The [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)") does however have a structure which includes valuable information about the nature and source of the identified component and the validity of the identifier. This structure supports the following features: 

  * [Check-digit](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/Check-digit "Glossary link: Check-digit") validation of the identifier. 

    * The [check-digit](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/check-digit "Glossary link: check-digit") is the final digit in the decimal rendering of the identifier. This can be checked to minimize errors from transcription or incomplete copy-paste actions. 

  * Partitioning between identifiers for different types of [SNOMED CT component](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+component "Glossary link: SNOMED CT component").

    * A two-digit [partition identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/partition+identifier "Glossary link: partition identifier") distinguishes the identifiers of different component types and prevents the same identifier from being allocated to both a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") and a [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description"). As a result, when an [SCTID](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/SCTID+\(data+type\) "Reference term: SCTID \(\(data type\)\)") is read from a record or other resource, it is possible to determine whether it represents a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"), a [relationship](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/relationship "Glossary link: relationship") or a [description](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/description "Glossary link: description"), before searching for the identified component. 

  * Namespaces to separate component identifiers originated by different organizations. 

    * Organizations are only permitted to issue identifiers which fall within a specified namespace of potential identifier values. This prevents collisions between identifiers issues by different organizations which would otherwise result in ambiguity and errors when sharing data. 

    * There are two formats used for representing namespaces. 
      * Short format in which [partition identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/partition+identifier "Glossary link: partition identifiers") are reserved for an organization which is permitted to issue any valid identifiers within the allocated partitions. The short format approach does not require a specific [namespace identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace+identifier "Glossary link: namespace identifier") and is only applicable to components originated and maintained by the [SNOMED International](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+International "Glossary link: SNOMED International") as part of the [International Release](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/International+Release "Glossary link: International Release") of [SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT").

      * Long format in which the [partition identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/partition+identifier "Glossary link: partition identifier") value indicates that a separate [namespace identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace+identifier "Glossary link: namespace identifier") is required to distinguish between components originated as part of an [extension](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension "Glossary link: extension") created by an appropriately authorized organization .
