# Namespace-Identifier

If the partition-identifier indicates a long format [SCTID](../appendices/appendix-b.-specification-reference-information/s/sctid-data-type.md), the seven-digits immediately to the left of the partition-digit are a namespace-identifier. The namespace-identifier is an integer value, left padded with 0 s as necessary to ensure there are always seven digits in the value. The namespace-identifier does not hold meaning.

Each organization that is authorized to generate SCTID is allocated a namespace-identifier by the SNOMED International. Each allocated namespace is represented in the Namespace Concept metadata sub-hierarchy, released as part of the International release (see details in The Namespace hierarchy ).
