# 6.9 The Namespace Hierarchy

[SNOMED CT core](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+core) [release files](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/release+file) include metadata [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept) that represent each of the allocated [namespace-identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/namespace-identifier).

A namespace concept has the following characteristics:

* It is a subtype child of [370136006 |Namespace concept|](http://snomed.info/id/370136006) .
* The fully specified name of the concept has the term
  * **Extension Namespace** _{nnnnnnn}_**(namespace concept)**
* A synonym associated with each concept has the term
  * **Extension Namespace** _{nnnnnnn}_
* Where appropriate further synonyms may be included to identify the nature of the responsible organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the terms shown above _{nnnnnnn}_ is the seven digit namespace identifier of the responsible organization.
