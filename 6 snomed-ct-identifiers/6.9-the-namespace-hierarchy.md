# The Namespace Hierarchy

SNOMED CT core release files include metadata concepts that represent each of the allocated namespace-identifiers.

A namespace concept has the following characteristics:

* It is a subtype child of [370136006 |Namespace concept|](http://snomed.info/id/370136006)
* The fully specified name of the concept has the term
  * **Extension Namespace** _{nnnnnnn}_**(namespace concept)**
* A synonym associated with each concept has the term
  * **Extension Namespace** _{nnnnnnn}_
* Where appropriate further synonyms may be included to identify the nature of the responsible organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the terms shown above _{nnnnnnn}_ is the seven digit namespace identifier of the responsible organization.
